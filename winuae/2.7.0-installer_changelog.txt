2.7.0

- If Picasso IV flash image is not found, show also link where to download it from.

Beta 16: (RC1)

- Z3 RTG base address was not adjusted if Processor Slot RAM was 128M.
- Writing to high BPL pointer when next cycle does same bitplane number DMA fetch: old address is
  used for fetch. (Powertrax / The Light Circle graphics glitch)
- Added workaround for Windows 8.1 bug, after SetCursorPos() call WM_MOUSEMOVE returns new coordinate
  as expected, then comes single message with old coordinate (this shouldn't happen) before it works
  correctly again. This fixes "Windows mouse" jumping ~50 pixels while moving the mouse. Rawinput HID
  mouse is not affected by this bug. (No, KB2908279 does not fix it, I guess working fix will be released someday)
- "Install mouse driver" + RTG mode has been unusable since 2600b1.
- Re-enabled "CIA TOD bug" by default but only in A500-like modes.
- Built-in HRTMon updated to 2.35
- Built-in AROS ROM updated. Added memory hack, bootup structures are allocated from hidden memory pool
  (located at 0xa80000-0xb80000, automatically enabled if built-in AROS rom is in use), when AROS starts
  booting from disk or HD, hidden pool is marked as full and all following allocations come from normal RAM.
  Now even 512k chip only config will boot and work with AROS rom replacement. Hack only used if CPU has 24-bit
  address bus. (68000/68010/68EC020).

Beta 15:

- Removing directory harddrives on the fly crashed in some situations.
- Interlace with black lines ("fields+") didn't always work correctly.
- Only allow GUI mininize button if emulation has not yet been started, minimizing GUI when emulation window
  is open only causes problems..
- Copper debugger (od) shows when blit waiting WAIT ends and also stores copper instruction words when
  copper fetched them, shows '!' if words have changed since copper fetched them. (Previously it was possible
  to see copper list in state that makes no sense if program modified it after copper executed it)
- Add 16M to Z3 start address if Processor slot RAM is set to 128M, prevents KS RAM detection to confuse Z3
  board as being part of Processor Slot RAM.
- Cirrus Logic graphics board enabled but inactive and refresh set to Chipset slowed down emulation.
- Sprite stuck in non-DMA mode was not correctly restored from statefile. (Has never worked previously)
- Adjusted programmed refresh rate blanking start and end position calculations.

Beta 14:

- GUI didn't work in fullscreen modes.
- Input panel lost all keyboard events (not even Test button accepted any key presses) in some situations,
  already non-working config files can't be fixed. Older bug.
- New frames interlace mode (without blacklines) now only redraws changed lines.
- 68040 without FPU: unimplemented FPU exception used wrong exception vector.
- 68020+ DIVL div-by-zero exception in cycle-exact mode didn't skip prefetch phase.
- Do not set lightpen triggered state when BPLCON0 lightpen bit is set unless lightpen is also configured
  in gameports or input panel.
- Fixed crash if disabled keyboard had (old) gameport mappings.
- Autoscale size change comparison used wrong value (width, not height) causing slow down, forced config
  change check every frame.
- Added configurable directory filesystem file/directory name length limit, currently config file only,
  filesys_max_name_length=x, files and dirs with longer names are not seen in Amiga-side (directory operations only)
- Really fixed sound sync timing issue, partly introduced in b1 and b13.

Beta 13:

- Standard partition hardfile OFS filesystem check was broken (2.6.1)
- Adjusted sprite xpos == hpos check. (Shed Tears / Ozone scroller)
- 64-bit build didn't load portaudio dll.
- GUI window minimize button worked strangely when emulation window was open.
- Added new interlace emulation modes, first new is same as old one but display is updated every field
  (Old doubling updated every frame) and another that does same and also blanks every other line.
- Added separate non-laced and lace doubling modes to GUI. (Better labels needed, but there is no space)
- Sound timing calculation wasn't updated to match new long/short field/interlace display emulation timing (b1).

Beta 12:

- AROS rom memory mapping fixed (b1).
- RTG mode video recording image size was accidentally restricted to native chipset size.
- Ignore VPOSW writes if it would move vertical position backwards or if vpos is changed during vertical
  blanking and new value is also inside vblank period. (Prevents strange behavior if program tries to
  do weird things)
- Added minimize button to GUI window.
- 68000 CE ADDA.x/SUBA.x Rn,An was 2 cycles too fast.
- DIVS/DIVU prefetch is after division operation, not before like with MULS/MULU.
- Adjusted data returned when accessing non-existing memory.
- New Wix based installer test version included. Remove old installation first.

Beta 11:

- 68000/010 CPU core merge accidentally removed 68000 CLR to memory and Scc to memory dummy read
  -modify-write behavior.
- Sometimes after autoswitch (unconfigured mouse left button press) mouse was configured correctly
  but mouse input was kept disabled.
- Using stick/dpad to autoswitch now requires move, release, move inside 0.5s window to prevent
  accidental switches.
- Some more autoswitch bugs fixed.
- Switching bitplane DMA on just before DDFSTRT handling improved. (Sargon Megademo "Shir Khan" part)
- 68030 + more compatible without cycle-exact was unstable.
- Flush 68020/030 caches and refill prefetch buffers when switching CPU modes (cycle-exact/more compatible)
  on the fly.
- 68020 cycle-exact improvements.
- Bitplane graphics was horizontally shifted if program switched from lores to hires less than 4 cycles
  before bitplane DMA starts. (Chipset emulation was correct but drawing code saw invalid lores to hires
  switch)
- Stupid code fixed in CD image audio code that coud cause random crashes.
- CD image audio start was delayed if audio was compressed (zip/mp3/flac/whatever) and start position
  was at the very end of previous track.

Beta 10:

- B8 Blerkenwiegel workaround caused buffer overflows in some situations. Fix improved.
- MoreNewStuffy fix (231b11) was not complete, non-modulo bitplane DMA fetches work
  differently than modulo adding DMA fetches. (Alpha and Omega / PMC)
- Also above behavior seems to only happen with first plane fetch. (New and Better Routines / Cult)
  This needs more testing, someday.. 
- '?' disk info button now opens normal dialog window, disk label also included (if dos disk) and
  type of bootblock (1.x standard, 2.x+ standard, custom)
- When loading config that has 2 identical game controllers configured in both ports and only one
  controller is connected, connected controller was inserted in both ports.
- GamePorts panel port change behavior improved, if new device is already inserted in other port,
  device in other port is now always automatically changed, not the one you just changed.
- When clicking mouse that is not inserted in either Amiga port and host system has only one mouse
  connected, "Windows mouse" is inserted, not HID mouse.
- 68020 more compatible without cycle-exact works again and also uses new 68020 CE prefetch method.
- 68010 is now supported in more compatible and cycle-exact modes. New instructions supported and
  new stack frames emulated but timing is same as 68000, 68010 special timing improvements and loop
  mode is not emulated. At least not yet.
- 68010 emulation used some 68020+ only exception stack frames.
- FPU emulator now properly uses prefetch buffer emulation if more compatible or cycle-exact is
  enabled. Emulated program crashed in older versions with some FPU instructions.
- On the fly switching from fastest possible to prefetch ("more compatible") or CE didn't fill
  prefetch buffers and usually caused emulated program to crash.
- Added "Log window" checkbox to Paths panel, easier non-command line method to open log window.
- On the fly change of A1000 Agnus or No-EHB Denise Advanced chipset didn't do anything.
- A1000 Agnus and vertical bitplane start (DIWSTRT) of zero: nothing happens, bitplanes are
  only enabled if it is 1 or larger.

Beta 9:

NOTE: 68020 CE mode should be usable again.

- Added CIA tod bug option to Advanced chipset. Demo The end / Trilobit running under
  KS 1.3 has corruption in "photos" part if tod alarm bug is not emulated. KS 1.3 + real A500
  does not have corruption. (I don't understand what is going on, some programs require this bug,
  some will hang if it is emulated. There has to be some unknown variable.)
- Writing to DIWSTOP during mid scanline and new value matches current vertical line:
  bitplane DMA fetches stop. Fixes Demo Starflight / Phenomena, OCS only.
  Interestingly ECS DMA fetches restart when DDFSTOP matches, causing scroller to jump horizontally.
- Writing to BPLxMOD exactly one cycle before bitplane fetch that also adds modulos
  uses old modulo value. (Copper Slave / Ram Jam)
- Mouse was uncaptured when switching from non-fullwindow to fullwindow mode.
- b8 hires unaligned check removed, it was wrong, logic analyzer confirmed.
- CMPA idle cycle was 2 cycles too slow in 68000 CE mode.
- Tape read command returned size of read request, not actual length which may be smaller than request size.
- OCS/ECS "7-planes" feature got broken in b8.
- HAM mode double pass display emulation's first pass didn't reset colors back to original before
  second pass. (Animotion / Phenomena)
- New memwatchpoint code didn't work with CIA registers.
- Log message if bitplane DMA ends at 0xe2 (can happen if start position is unaligned enough), this causes
  odd looking corruption on real hardware. (each scanline has random looking few pixels shift). Previously
  only DMA that ended at the start of next scanline were logged.
- Sprite vertical start == sprite DMA first line won't enable sprites. (Ultrademo #1 / The Link)
- If windowed mode was reset (for example RTG to custom chipset mode change) and mouse was not captured
  but window had focus: input got disabled, extra mouse click was required to enable input.
- Copper cycles were emulated too early before bitplane DMA decisions, copper might have used
  cycle reserved for bitplane DMA in some situations.
- Added "?" buttons to floppy GUIs. Current implementation is very lazy, few lines of information,
  boot block contents and it opens in default text editor.
- Limit VPOSW refresh rate display size changes to sane values, min display size is 256 lines and max
  is not allowed outside PAL size. Reduces flickering if program does something really weird or stupid
  with VPOSW.

Second 68EC020 cycle-exact emulation rewrite. Timing may not be much better but cycle usage emulation
should be much more closer to real hardware. (This needs logic analyzer check but I don't have
all required hardware yet)

Lots of work left to do but at least it should not be any worse than old code and it also should be
much more accurate now when code has small loops (for example stupid CPU delays).

If there are no demos or games that break or run really badly compared to 2.6.1, this is not anymore
showstopper for 2.7.0 release.

NOTE: 68030 can queue data memory accesses, this is not yet emulated.

Beta 8:

NOTE: Still no 68020/030 CE mode changes. Do not use.

- Added CD32 MPEG ROM 40.22 (part number 391777-01) to ROM scanner.
- GUI 1x/2x/4x/custom CPU speed setting showed incorrect selection (b7)
- Added "I am Windows 8.1 compatible" manifest entry.
- Workaround for Blerkenwiegel/Scoopex breakage (261b1). May cause side-effects.
- 68000 mode "CPU trace" state file restore errors should be gone (270b4)
- 260b15 sprite update off-by-one fix. (Missing vertical sprite line in Prurient/Rebels and others)
- Enabling hires bitplanes (by writing to BPLCON0 or enabling DMA) during first 4 hires
  fetch units didn't wait for next complete fetch unit block (should have skipped next 4
  "unaligned" hires fetch units) causing shifted graphics. Partially fixes RAF Megademo
  single line of shifted scroller in vector part.
- Short horizontal line of incorrect graphics was visible in some very rare situations,
  internal buffer was not correctly cleared. (SillyScroller / Phenomena)
- ATAPI MODE SENSE (10) returned too much data if request size was small enough.
- Return INVALID COMMAND error if ATAPI and command was MODE SENSE (6). ATAPI only supports
  10 byte variant of MODE SENSE.
- Added SEEK(6) and SEEK(10) commands to SCSI CD emulation.
- Some decompression formats (at least lha) were not compatible with file type detection.
  (for example lha containing executable didn't mount as a floppy image)
- BTST Dn,#data was accidentally marked as invalid addressing mode in b7.
- Power supply TOD counting accuracy was not that good in earlier update.
- 8-bit bmp screenshots were broken (Only created when capturing 8-bit RTG mode)
- Ignore window size changes if emulation window is minimized. Readjust size (if needed) when unminimized.
- Picasso IV flifi/VGA output enable logic tweak (Linux Cirrus Logic console)

Beta 7: READ NOTE BELOW BEFORE USING!

- SCSI UNIT ATTENTION/MEDIA MAY HAVE CHANGED clears when TEST UNIT READY is executed, not
  when UA status is read by using REQUEST SENSE. Fixes ATAPI CD disk change issues with
  some AOS ATAPI drivers.
- Accessing real CD (or CD emulator) in non-SPTI mode returned read errors depending on what
  kind of imaginary geometry IOCTL_CDROM_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY returned.
- Memory bank change (reset) removed new memwatch debugger watchpoints.
- Built-in lzx decompressor didn't always decompress last byte of file correctly...
- b4 drive spinup update change: also don't enumerate drives if new config entry is found but
  drive path fails to open and returns "not found" error (for example USB card reader not connected)
- When switching from RTG to native fullscreen or vice versa, re-open fullscreen mode if number
  of backbuffers, selected monitor, refreshrate or vsync mode is different.
- New adf or hdf path was not converted to relative in relative path mode.
- Added VID 0x79d, PID 0x0201 ("USB  ADAPTOR") analog joystick to USB adapter to rawinput blacklist.
- "Error log" button becomes visible in bottom part of GUI if any kind of config error was detected
  or config required fixing, for example directory or harddrive failed to open, attempting to enable
  Z3 fast with 24-bit address space CPU etc. (Currently many messages can be confusing and not all
  important messages are enabled)
- Tape drive LOAD/UNLOAD SCSI command fix, error message during Amix 2.1 retension tape command.
- Picasso IV in Z2 mode + Z2 Fast RAM enabled used incorrect internal memory mapping
  (missing graphics etc..)
- Only call D3D SetMaximumFrameLatency() when buffer flipping mode is immediate. Vsync waited flipping
  caused major slowdown if emulation created frames faster than current display refresh rate.
- Increased "CPU slot" Max RAM size from 64M to 128M.

- Removed 68040+ "cycle-exact" support. It was useless and does not fit in new 68020/030 ce handling
  without creating new CPU emulation core.
- Added 68020 and 68030 instruction cache dump command to debugger ("rc"). * = data valid.
- JIT + more compatible problem fixed.

!IMPORTANT NOTE!
Following is work in progress. Do not use 68020/030 cycle-exact modes. Timing is broken. Other modes work fine.

- Added 68030 manual head/tail/clocks timing values to table68k, gencpu automatically calculates
  final values for 68020 (=68030 + 1 wait state added) and 68030 cores using table68k values and
  EA timing formulas. Only includes 680x0 common instruction so far, 68020+ only instructions and
  addressing modes and rarely used instructions do not have cycle-exact timing yet.


Beta 6:

- Enabled Cirrus Logic RTG VRAM size configuration. CL VRAM memory bank setups used by VRAM size
  detection code is now (partially) emulated, should be enough to support CGX and Picasso96.
- Fixed crash that usually happened when system was reset and if it caused immediate PAL/NTSC
  mode change. (2.5 or 2.6 bug)
- Removed some dead JIT code, "afterPic" and "indirectKS" comptrustxxx parameters that haven't been
  used for ages.
- JIT MOVEM used direct mode if memory was direct capable but direct mode was disabled.
- Picasso IV VRAM is now always (*) in JIT indirect access mode. It can't be made JIT Direct compatible
  due to multiple banks. Also P4 Z2 CGX 15/16 bit mode has graphics corruption if JIT Direct is enabled
  because of JIT issue that can't be fixed. If same code is used to copy data from RAM and it is later
  used to copy data from VRAM, there is no way for JIT to detect that it should recompile it and
  use indirect mode instead of (incorrect for this bank) JIT direct mode. Other boards are very
  simple and can support JIT direct VRAM access.
- *) P4 Z3 mode includes now a hack that makes it JIT direct compatible. At least it seems to work..
- Cirrus emulation large basic copy blits are now 4x faster. (P96Speed horiz/vert scroll tests are not
  extremely slow anymore)

Beta 5:

- Spectrum 28/24 official name is EGS-28/24 Spectrum.
- Stupid bug in b4 CD image update. Some CD32 games refused to play first audio track.
- Some CUE images with both INDEX0 and INDEX1 and audio tracks in separate files may have played 1-2
  seconds of previous track when starting CD audio.
- Added partial support for non-direct JIT only memory mapping support that allows Z3 boards in their
  original non-hacked OS chosen base address (0x40000000-> vs 0x10000000->). Not available yet.
- More old 68020 CE state files load now but note that it is impossible to support all of them with new
  emulation code.
- Some 68020 CE mode timing tweaks.
- Emulate Picasso IV byteswapped VRAM bank (5446 CL chip feature) Fixes CGX 15/16 bit modes.
- Cirrus Logic blitter emulation bug fixed (Inversion + Color expansion + Transparency combination uses
  foreground color, there is no background vs foreground swapping like in all other inverted modes)
  Fixes graphics glitches in Picasso IV 24-bit Picasso96 modes.

Beta 4:

- Picasso IV RTG board emulation implemented. Very important information:
  - Requires full 128k raw flash rom image, available from
    http://www.sophisticated-development.de/ (PIV_FlashImageXX), renamed as picasso_iv_flash.rom
  - Does not use rom scanner system, image file must be located in Paths panel configured rom path.
  - Very big thanks to Tobias Seiler for answering questions about board's hardware implementation.
  - Do not bother Tobias (or anyone else) who does not develop UAE with Picasso IV emulation problems.
  - Only implements basic functionality, flifi or other extra stuff is not emulated.
  - Real Picasso IV uses flifi when displaying Amiga modes, emulation ignores it and simply displays
    Amiga modes normally.
  - Picasso96 and CGX4 confirmed working.

- Piccolo autoconfig size change reverted, problem appears to be caused by EGS 7.4 driver bug.
- >1024 pixel tall interlace mode fix.
- CL vertical blank handling fixed, it caused spurious interrupts in some situations.
- uaegfx driver was enabled if on-disk version was loaded and hardware board emulation was configured.

- CIA TOD counting delay emulated. Time between TICK input going active and TOD increasing has
  14-16 E-clock cycle delay. Logic analyzer confirmed using ALARM interrupt.
- Disabled CIA TOD bug emulation. It makes no sense, I have AGA program that refuses to work on
  my real A1200 (Gets unexpected interrupt and crashes) but there is no way it didn't work 20
  or so years ago..

- Workaround for hard drive enumeration waking up sleeping drives if one or more harddrives are
  mounted in configuration and emulation is started. To enable it, all configured real harddrives
  (or memory cards) need to be re-configured using GUI and config saved to create new config field
  required to find the drive without enumeration. Falls back to full enumeration if drive's "friendly"
  name does not match config saved value or new config entry is missing.
- Simplified CIA interrupt handling, removed some old hack which appears to be obsolete. I hope.
- Added CPU interrupt level information to visual DMA debugger. Each scanline has extra pixel on left side
  of DMA usage image that shows scanline's highest CPU interrupt level.

- Rewritten 68020/030 cycle-exact emulation core. Emulates 68020 simultaneous bus controller and
  instruction execution more accurately. It still runs too fast, but at least it is less fast than
  previously, still lots of tweaking to do but at least now it should be possible to match real 68020
  more closely than what was possible with old code.
- 68020/030 CPU emulation updates, prefetch emulation (also used in cycle-exact mode) should be much
  more compatible, "more compatible" checked without cycle-exact now also includes instruction cache emulation.
- 68030+ more compatible (prefetch) and 68040+ "cycle-exact" modes are broken temporarily. Do not use.
- Restoring old 68020 cycle-exact saved state files may show dialog complaining about mismatched state
  information and restore may also fail. It is normal, will be fixed later.
- Cycle-exact CPU accesses to AGA custom registers used 32-bit accesses, not 16-bit.
- b3 .cue decoding update broke some variants, fixed.
- Added workaround for Windows returning returning invalid (too small) value when asking for
  ACM_METRIC_MAX_SIZE_FORMAT. (Output panel crashing)

Beta 3:

- Disable Z3 Cirrus Logic RTG board if 24-bit address space.
- Hard reset and CL board enabled crashed.
- Added Chipset/RTG screen toggle input event ("Toggle chipset/RTG screen"). Only works when RTG mode is active,
  supports both Cirrus Logic emulation and uaegfx. NOTE: temporarily also hardwired to END + F9.
- VGA planar modes (<=16 colors) work now.
- VGA text modes confirmed working (NetBSD and OpenBSD enable VGA console automatically if supported board detected)
- Piccolo appears to have 4M address space (VRAM alias). Fixes EGS 7.4 graphics bugs and missing mouse cursor.
- >1024 pixel tall modes work now correctly, including cursor vertical positioning (see below).
- GD542x documentation says hardware cursor can't be used if "Multiply Vertical Registers by Two" bit is set
  (allows >1024 pixel tall modes, wasn't emulated in original qemu code) unless chip is GD5429 or later. But
  CGX4 does use it with boards that only had GD5426 or GD5428. I guess it only happens when cgxmode is used
  to create impossible modes that no real monitor or chip can support...

- Added misc panel "Hide all UAE autoconfig boards" option. It deletes all UAE-only autoconfig
  board ConfigDev nodes in ExpansionBase.
- Rewritten .cue decoding, some CD images with audio tracks had incorrect audio positioning,
  for example Tie Break Tennis CDTV and Falcon CDTV.
- Log also physical/virtual CD drive track information.
- CIA-A vsync TOD counting is now cycle-exact. (if cycle values in Commodore's Agnus sync pulse timing sheet
  are correct, they appear to be because it is standard PAL/NTSC)
- CIA-B hsync TOD counting is also positioned cycle-exactly now (end of hsync pulse), was at the start of
  scanline previously.
- SPTI didn't work, SCSI routing got broken when Tape drive support was added.

Beta 2:

- Fixed Piccolo SD64 Z2 wrong address space size.
- Piccolo is Z2/Z3 board.
- Fixed Z3 board subsize.
- Improved QEMU CL emulation glue code, VRAM banking/offsets supported.
- Some modes had invisible hardware sprite (mouse cursor).
- Implemented Piccolo/SD64/Spectrum vblank interrupts. Picasso96 won't hang anymore.
- Reset didn't reset all necessary graphics board variables.
- Force 32-bit host display mode if byteswapped board is selected (Any board except PicassoII/II+)
  Cirrus Logic emulation code supports byteswapping only in 32-bit mode.
- Note: Most VGA planar modes (16 colors or less) are not working. Includes also mouse cursor.

- Rewritten memory bank handling, moved all memory variables (start address, mask, size, etc)
  to addrbank stucture. Standard RAM bank code duplication replaced with macros.
- Debugger memwatch points now also detect hits in aliased addresses and only bank(s) that have
  watched addresses are redirected to debugger.
- CDTV SCSI option works again.
- Some uaenet.device improvements.
- It was not possible to write to Amithlon-style partitions.
- 5:4 aspect ratio had disappeared.
- CIA-A TOD counts (if vsync timed) on line 5 (PAL) or line 6 (NTSC), not line 0.
  (This is not 100% accurate yet, horizontal position is still wrong, will be
  improved in later betas)
- Installer update also coming, will be built with WiX (msi installer).

Beta 1:

- Hardware Cirrus Logic based SVGA Zorro II/III RTG board emulation.
- SLIRP user mode NAT emulation.
- Added SCSI tape emulation. Amix tape based install works, also tested with
  Quarterback and Diavolo.
- lua scripting support added from fs-uae. Very minimal at the moment.
- SCSI HD/CD/TAPE statefile compatibility improved.
- SCSI emulation compatibility improved, Amix use of WD Select and Transfer
  used wrong data size when direction was from WD to device and command was not
  write command, for example MODE SELECT.
- Show custom chip mode as interlace/not interlaced decision now more closely matches
  real hardware behavior. (No, it isn't as simple as BPLCON0 LACE bit set/not set)
- Show also device type (HDF, CD, TAPE) in Harddrives panel.
- Joystick axis dead-zone fix, wired xbox 360 d-pad missed events, it didn't affect
  wireless version. (261b2)
- Top and/or bottom border showed graphics garbage if AGA sprites outside of bitplane
  area feature was enabled and in use and screen mode was HAM. (Tint / Black Lotus)
- Dragging and dropping archive/file to WB tried (unsuccesfully) replace already
  existing normal directory harddrive if dropped file and directory harddrive had same
  base path.
- Renamed CPU cycle exact speed multipliers and added 1x speed (1:1 CPU/DMA clock sync)
- It was impossible to select RTG aspect ratio select box Automatic value.
- Display panel depth select box was not updated if new resolution had more or less
  depth choices than previously selected resolution.
- Mouse was captured even if "Start mouse uncaptured" was ticked and booting to RTG mode.
- Amiga side does not anymore see .lnk extension if it is valid Windows shortcut softlink.
- Enabling JIT for the first time in GUI now always forces JIT Direct mode.
- If blitter was started one cycle before final D write (Cycle which is always unused by
  blitter), new blit's 2 cycle startup incorrectly accepted DMA cycles that were not free.
  (Day of Reckoning / Digital)
- Bitplane DMA incorrectly stole sprite DMA in some situations (Plastic Passion / Upfront)
- Sync clock when resuming from sleep/hibernate (if clock sync option is ticked)

SLIRP notes:

- Available for A2065 and uaenet.device (uaenet unit 0 = slirp, 1 = first WinPCap device)
- Does not need any drivers, uses normal WinSock API.
- NAT, outbound connections only.
- TCP and UDP only (no ICMP or other ethernet frame types)
- DHCP supported.
- Manual settings: IP 10.0.2.15, Gateway 10.0.2.2, DNS 10.0.2.3, Mask 255.255.255.0.

Hardware graphics board emulation notes:

- Currently emulates following Cirrus Logic GD542X/543X based boards:
  - Picasso II
  - Picasso II+
  - Piccolo
  - Piccolo SD 64 (Zorro II and III)
  - Spectrum 28/24 (Zorro II and III)
  - Picasso IV may be implemented in future.
- Uses QEMU Cirrus Logic SVGA graphics chip emulation.
- Picasso 96 and CyberGraphX v4 tested.
- Works with non-AmigaOS operating systems that don't support UAEGFX RTG board.
- Vertical blank timing uses GUI configured refresh rate value, display sync settings programmed
  to VGA chip are completely ignored.
- Only single VRAM size supported which is hardware supported max VRAM. Smaller VRAM requires
  emulating of VRAM aliasing and banking stuff that drivers use for VRAM size detection. It would
  become too Direct mode JIT unfriendly. Future "more compatible but slower" option is possible.

SCSI Tape notes:

- Tape path can point to directory, archive or plain file.
- Directory: all files in directory are included in virtual tape, ordered in whatever
  order OS returns the directory (unless index.tape is found), emulated file mark
  is between each file. Subdirectories are ignored.
- Archive: All files in archive are included, including subdirectories.
- Plain single file: tape only contains selected single file.
- If directory or archive and index.tape is found, it is assumed to contain order of
  files in virtual tape, plain file name strings separated by line feeds.
- Writing is also supported if path points to a directory. Creates files named
  xxxxx.tape where xxxxx is file number.
- Tape ERASE command only deletes files that have extension .tape to prevent
  accidental data loss. Subdirectories are also ignored.
- Can be connected to SCSI hardware emulation (SCSI0-6) or uaescsi.device (UAE),
  uaescsi.device unit number is always 4 or larger (if 4 was already used by
  some CD device).
- Tape change on the fly is supported.

lua scripting:

- very minimal and basic at the moment.
- lua=<path to script> in config file, multiple files supported.
- lua/default.lua is loaded by default.
- supported UAE-specific functions:
  uae_log, uae_read_u8, uae_read_u16, uae_peek_u16, uae_write_u8, uae_write_u16
  uae_read_config, uae_write_config.
- lua functions:
  on_uae_vsync (every vsync)
  on_uae_config_changed (any config value has changed)
