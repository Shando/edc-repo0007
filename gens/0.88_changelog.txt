(23/10/2000) Changes Gens 0.88 <- Gens 0.8 :
--------------------------------------------

* Country select feature added.
* Menu language support improved :
  Menu is dynamically rebuild from language.dat file so it's very easy to add or change
  a menu language.
* English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Hebrew menu language are actually supported.
* Screen-Shot feature added.
* Direct Draw code modified :
  - 'Normal' and 'Double' render mode uses hardware blit in Fullscreen.
  - Screen Size x1, x2 removed in windowed mode because not usefull.
  - Screen refresh improved when emulation is paused.
* My 68000 core and MZ80 core are removed because RAZE and custom Starscream are accurate.
* Debugger rewritten for Starscream.
* Message drawing code rewritten.
* GENS becomes cardware.
* I figured that Gens played Genesis voices (especially in SSFII) better than the
  real genesis, the bug is now fixed so voices are now more crap with almost game :(
* others fix or improvements ...

Known game broken :
Double Dragon 2 (this game is very sensitive to CPU timing :( )

Known game fixed :
Frogger.
