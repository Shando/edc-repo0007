The following changes have been made between the version 0.5.3-beta1 and
this version 0.5.3-beta2 release:

- The problem where the 0.5.3-beta1 version displays a "You have exceeded
the evaluation time limit" message immediately after starting emulation
is fixed.

- A small number of minor bugs have also been fixed.

- Color-coding of the disc timecode display has been added:
blue for TOC / yellow for CR-ROM / green for CD-I / red for CD-DA,
based on a suggestion by Anna Wu.

- The internals of CD-i Emulator have been restructured somewhat to
enable OS-9 emulation, but this functionality is not yet included in
this public release.

- More OS9 system calls are now correctly traced in the debug window.

If you have bug reports, comments or suggestions please post them on
the CD-i Emulator Support Forum at http://www.cdinteractive.co.uk/forum
(you will need to register) so that other people can also find the
information. 

Have fun!
