(21/03/2000) Changes Gens 0.34 <- Gens 0.3 :
--------------------------------------------

- Starscream 68000 is available, changes :
  - More roms work fine (about 75% :)
  - Faster than mine !
  - Debugger doesn't work with Starscream !
- RAZE Z80 core added, but there are some problems with certain roms aladdin, sonic ...)
  but it works better than MZ80 in other cases (animaniacs, contra4 ...).
- Shortcuts added (Save / Load state, frame skip ... see below)
- Sound is now stopped when clicking on menu or resizing the window ...
- Current directory stored (but not yet in a file, just when you keep gens running)
- Some optimizations -> some more FPS :)
- Bug fixes (DirectSound init, key settings ...)
- Others I can't remember ....
