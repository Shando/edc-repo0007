2.5.1

- Only reserve max total physical memory / 2 of ram under 32 bit Windows versions.
- lzh/lha MSDOS-style timestamps supported

Beta 5: (Possibly 2.5.1 final)

- Fixed crash when reset caused switching from RTG to native mode. (b3)
- Power led (and audio filter if enabled) state was not updated correctly (2.5.0)
- Exiting pause mode kept mouse uncaptured in some situations (b4)

Beta 4:

- Floppy read/write checkboxes didn't work (b1 filesystem update)
- Writing to Maprom region crashed in JIT mode, ROM protection introduced in 25b6 is now disabled when maprom address is queried for the first time.
- Inserting or ejecting USB game controller removed all Game Ports panel custom mappings. (older bug)
- Only attempt to mount dragged zip as a harddrive if harddrive emulation is enabled, if no harddrives, attempt to insert as a disk image in DF0:.
- Some mouse tweaks when fullscreen mode on secondary monitor positioned on left side of primary monitor (negative coordinates).
- Harddrives panel CD file selection box file name was truncated if path contained "][" string.
- uaeexe_server UAE boot ROM hook was set even if uae boot rom was disabled (Does something use this hook? seems ancient..)
  This corrupted part of CDTV extended ROM in b2 and 2.5.0 versions. (b3 initialization order change partially fixed it)

Beta 3:

- bsdsocket was initialized too early, didn't configure if memory config changed due to not enough physical memory etc.. (old bug)
- 32-bit Windows memory reservation limit was too small, some old configs had more memory available under 2.4.x and older versions (2.5)
- Crash dump file is written to data path or TEMP if winuae.exe directory is write protected.
- Do not crash if sound is enabled and number of sound output devices is zero.
- Archive directory filesystem crash fixed (b1)
- SCSI emulation READ commands returned data from wrong track (following track if CD had more than 1 tracks). Argh.
- Back to MSVC 2010, 2012 seems to have some optimization and XP compatibility issues to solve, later..

Beta 2:

- Resuming pause with input event didn't restore sound. (b1)
- Do not capture mouse when theme changes, keep pause state (Window may not get refreshed until unpaused, this won't be fixed until later) (b1)
- Windows mouse mode and mouse not captured: right, middle and other possible extra mouse buttons leaked to Amiga side.
- Fixed GUI JIT slider weird behavior when cache size slider was moved to zero.
- Windowed mode status bar appeared in full window modes after mode change (b1)
- Epson matrix color printing swapped red and blue fixed. (Printing only, png output worked)
- Fixed 68010 + cycle-exact broken interrupt handling. (This is not recommended option, it is far from cycle-exact)
- Optimized build (official b1) had wrong settings, didn't load on Windows XP.

Beta 1:

- Internal mouse counter under/overflow fixed, while moving mouse far enough, mouse jumped in opposite direction. (old bug)
- Directory filesystem file modification date resolution support is now 1 microsecond (was 1 second). AmigaDOS file
  time 1/50s "tick" resolution is now fully supported (if NTFS, FAT only has 2 second resolution)
- 1G RTG RAM was detected as "too large". (early 250 beta)
- ClipCursor() was not always called, it was possible for hidden Windows mouse to move outside of WinUAE window in some situations. (250b24)
- RTG aspect ratio still affected filter panel aspect ratio setting. (b26 update was not complete)
- _UAEFSDB.___ meta data files (stores illegal names, protection flags and comments if non-stream capable filesystem like FAT)
  haven't worked correctly for a long time.
- _UAEFSDB.___ wasn't always deleted when it become empty.
- Unminimizing unpaused emulation when "pause when mouse is uncaptured" was enabled.
- If win32.guikey config entry is set, normal GUI key (F12) events won't open the GUI anymore.
- Always reset special monitor active flag (A2024/Graffiti) when display mode changes, fixes A2024 mode position when window
  needs to reopen but resolution didn't change.
- Improved windowed mode bottom statusbar height calculation, fixes two pixel gap in Windows Vista classic mode.
- Fixed Amiga-side illegal memory access when booting directory harddrive(s) under KS 1.3.
- Reset GUI/emulation display when Windows desktop state changes (Theme change etc..)
- Removed remains of unused AROS CDFS support code.
- Compiled using MSVC 2012 with update 1 installed.
