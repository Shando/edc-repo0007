The most important change to Win994a with this new version is the addition of a Hard Disk Controller, and three Hard Disk Drives. Please see Using Win994a's Hard Disks, for more information. This addition replaces the older RamDisk capability. Several folks suggested the RamDisk drives were wasted and that a true hard disk capability would be better. Sorry, to those users who liked the RamDisks. Please make yourself heard if you just can't live without RamDisk. 
*Note - Hey! To all you TI-99/4a assembly coders out there. The new hard disk capability desperately needs a Hard Disk Manager Cartridge to be written and made available to the public. The author of Win994a was going to write and develop one of these that would operate in a similar manner to TI's Disk Manager Module. The idea is to develop the assembly code and convert the resulting object code to a binary memory image file(s), like those files extracted from original TI cartridges. Then the Cartridge Creator Dialog Box could be used to make an actual Win994a compatible cart file. However, this might be a nice project for all you TI hobbyists and/or support groups. Please feel free to create a Win994a Hard Disk Manager Cartridge and place it on Rich Polivka's excellent TI website so we can all use it. Refer to the Adobe Reader file, Win994a_HD.pdf (located in the same folder where Win994a was installed) for all the Hard Drive Controller, Internal File Data Structures, and supporting firmware subroutine specifics necessary to support such a project. Give it a shot, and good luck!
- A bug fix to Win994a's TIDisk.dll has corrected a few problems with the TI Forth program. The fix turned out to be the correction of only one addition byte in the Video Processor Memory. This fix could potentially repair a similar problem in other applications, but I'm not aware of them. 
- Another fix to TIDisk.dll corrected a problem with the way protected files are reported to BASIC. Protected files are supposed to return a negative value in the file type field. Win994a does this correctly now.
- A large portion of the TMS9918a video simulation code was reviewed and enhanced. For most computers, this will cause less CPU overhead during operation. In addition, a correction to the code should fix an interaction problem between static graphic character definitions, and graphic definitions for moving sprites. 
- As always, please have lots of fun with Win994a Simulator.
