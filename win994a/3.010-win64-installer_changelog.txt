This version of Win994a is fairly light on changes. Mainly, these are technical internal modifications and most folks won't see any difference. 
- The "X" (eXecute) cpu opcode has been modified to function correctly. In past versions, failure of this opcode caused several cartridges to malfunction, often resulting in crashes and Win994a reboots. Opcodes that set the "carry flag" were modified slightly. 
- The Win994a Preferences Dialog has been modified to include a fast 16bit access  32K Extended Memory option. 
- The Disk Manager application has virtually stayed the same. 
- The assembler application has been revised and updated to correct a problem with the resulting machine code generated by a few conditional branch op codes. 
- As always, please have lots of fun with Win994a Simulator.
