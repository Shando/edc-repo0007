Changes from 0.22 to 0.23
-------------------------
  * Added a shorthand to pack attributes in structs, to make the drivedisk
    structure tighter.
  * Moved the disk structure into dapple.h.
  * DOS file errors now display the C error message.  (But I don't like that
    the libc displays the C error enum value (e.g., ENOENT) next to the
    error message.  Is this a djgpp-specific thing, or is there some other
    libc that does this, like BSD libc?)
  * Added an experimental dynamic version of Dapple ][ (that is, RAM is
    allocated dynamically, rather than statically).  With the new dapple2d,
    your mileage may vary, but this might become the only version of Dapple
    ][ in the future.
  * Cleaned up the source a little bit, partly to streamline the MAKE
    process.
