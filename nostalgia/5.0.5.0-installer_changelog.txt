    to Direct3d to be compatible with more video cards.

  frame skipping and allows an adaptive frakeskip model.
  Screenshots now take a proper picture of the game screen,
    including the border.
  Screenshots are now available in BMP, JPG or PNG formats.

  Sped up the beginning of the game display so you're not
    looking at a blank window for too long.

    errors and corrupted databases.  It also handles new
    database versions much better.

  Games can now be assigned a category for custom sorting.
