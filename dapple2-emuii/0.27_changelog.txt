Changes from 0.26 to 0.27
-------------------------
  * Fixed bugs in the mk.bat file.
  * Disabled the conversion of the printer to explicit binary mode; it can
    be reinstated, if in fact it was not a bug.
  * When Dapple ][ cannot find an appropriate video mode, it will now die
    more gracefully.
