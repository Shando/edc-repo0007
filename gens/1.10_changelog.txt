(21/09/2001) Changes Gens 1.10 <- Gens 1.00 :
---------------------------------------------

* Prelemenary SEGA CD emulation added :
  - Sub 68000 (100%)
  - Prg Ram and Word Ram implemented (95%)
  - PCM chip (100% but stil buggy)
  - GFX rotation and enlargement (60%)
  - Font color/data (100%)
  - CDD (70%)
  - CDC (60%)
  - BRAM saves supported.
  - No graphics conversion, no ISO support, no save state support yet.
* Added an option to improve the DAC sound (voices) or not.
  This option can be enabled/disabled only by key-shorcut (see in the shorcuts section)
  because i don't recommend you to always use it since this can cause sound bugs with some games.
* Added the possibility to force software blit for Fullscreen "Normal" and "Double" render mode.
  This option can be enabled/disabled only by key-shorcut (see in the shorcuts section) because almost
  people don't need to use it, try it only for speed issue.
* We can now choose the order of country detection.
* Undocumented scroll mode implemented.
* Undocumented plan size mode implemented.
* Rewrite the VDP IO control part, little speed increase.
* Fixed VDP sprite table register (bug added in Gens 1.00)
* Fixed a bug in VDP control decoding (Gens v0.8 was right about it).
* Fast-blur fixed for no MMX processor.
* A minor bug in DAC recovering sound has been fixed.


Game Fixed:
- All games broken in Gens 1.00 (missing sprites)
- European Club Soccer (pause screen)
- Populous / unofficial release (EA logo intro)
