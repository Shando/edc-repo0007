Changes from 0.23 to 0.24
-------------------------
  * Preparations to include linear framebuffer support on VESA 2 cards which
    support it.
  * Cosmetic tweaks (to the main menu and the About dialog).
  * Alt-F4 works.  Shift-F9 has been removed.
  * Added support for altering the volume number of DO and PO-type disk
    images.
  * Added support for the effect where double hi-res mode is entered in
    40-column mode (which is, technically speaking, illegal).
  * Fixed bugs in my code to retrieve and display strerror().
  * Added German translation of some messages.
  * Allowed Backspace to be treated like the corresponding key on the //e
    keyboard (as in Dapple 1.25).
  * Reimplemented the Shift Key Mod (in //e mode only).
  * Some //e-only switches removed from //c emulation.
  * MouseText works in 40-column mode.
