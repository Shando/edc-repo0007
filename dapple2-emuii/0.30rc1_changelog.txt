Changes from 0.30pt6 to 0.30RC1 (including 0.28)
------------------------------------------------
  * Disabled the REE in normal builds; the ROM emulation module will not
    be included in official distributions.  The hooks will be available
    if the program is recompiled.  Define REECOP (the instruction used
    to access the REE in capable versions of EMU][ is the 65816 "COP"
    instruction).
  * Additional i18n support.
  * File dialog supports entering any filename as Dapple 1.25 did (WIP).
  * Macro assembler can be called from the CPU menu.
  * Cosmetic adjustments.
