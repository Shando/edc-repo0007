(14/03/2000) Changes Gens 0.3 <- Gens 0.24 :
--------------------------------------------

- Starscream 68000 core (faster and more accurate than mine) is now
  implemented but deactivated, it'll be active in the next version !
- DAC works now perfectly (can hear 'SEGA' chord in sonic games :)
- Many many fixes in sound and CPU timings:
  - All chips (68000, Z80, YM2612, PSG ...) are synchronized depending on the
    game type (PAL 50Hz / SECAM 60Hz) and PAL games work at 50 FPS in
    auto-frameskip mode.
  - Fix YM2612 timers.
  - Fix PSG rate.
- Can choose sound sample rate (you must reload the rom for that to take effect !)
- Some little others...

There are some glitches with the DAC speed with some games (just hear the voices in
aladdin, cool-spot, lemmings ...)
