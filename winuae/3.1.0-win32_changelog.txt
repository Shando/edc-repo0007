3.1.0

- Unticked "Game controllers disabled" works now in DirectInput mode.
- 68030 data cache fix.

Beta 23: (RC3)

- Toccata audio didn't automatically re-enable audio if it was stopped by automatic switching.
- Fixed A2065 crash in "Cable disconnected" mode.
- Added J.Kommos ROM v1.7 (1990-03-13) Previously added ROM was v1.8 (1990-07-25).
- Preferred Technologies Nexus added to ROM scan result window.
- Fixed 68030 MMU prefetch hack flaw that caused A3000 with 2.04 SuperKickstart to crash.
- "Mouse uncaptured: emulation paused" and any key pressed: key was not released automatically (ALT-TAB).
- 68881/68882 NULL FSAVE frame has normal frame size stored (Undocumented but real hardware confirmed)
- Don't prevent RTC in A1200 chipset extra mode if accelerator board is also enabled.
- HD selection GUI visual bugs fixed.
- Added input device autoswitch on/off checkbox. (This was supposed to be added long time ago but I forgot)

Beta 22: (RC2)

- In some rare situatations both "HARD_DDF_STOP" and "plf_passed_stop" test conditions incorrectly passed
  in single fetch block. Only happened when DDFSTRT/DDFSTOP value pair caused bitplane dma overrun
  so result was different corrupted display. (Plastic Passion / Upfront plasma part with OCS Agnus)
- BPL DMA pointer modified one cycle before same channel's BPLxDAT gets accessed behavior adjusted.
  (Powertrax / The Light Circle)
- Archos ADD-500 is also confirmed having fast ram autoconfig board after HD controller.

Beta 21: (RC1)

- b17 DSKSYNC update should not have started DMA in WORDSYNC mode.
- Moved A590/A2091 ram autoconfig board after HD board. A2091 install disk RAM tester expects it.
  (Some other boards may also have wrong HD/Fast RAM board order)
- Debugger deep trainer "not modified" condition fixed.
- AROS ROM updated.

Beta 20:

- Drive sound noise fixed. (b19)
- FireCracker 24 6-bit (R2G2B2) overlay fully emulated.
- Video-only recording is now possible. (Audio codec can be disabled by canceling audio dialog)
- Chip RAM mirroring disappeared in b3.
- Do not crash if on the fly switching from non-uae boot rom config to boot rom config.
- Bus error emulation in non-MMU mode (not really Amiga specific) didn't call do_specialties() correctly.

Beta 19:

- Switching from non-lace to/from lace didn't always select correct long/short/interlace frame timing.
- SCSI CD READ TOC and READ SUB-CHANNEL returned failure instead of truncating result if command's
  allocation length was smaller than returned data structure.
- If cycle-exact and sound is Disabled: force Disabled, but emulated.
- Added Preferred Technologices Nexus MEM TEST -jumper, clears autoconfig add to memlist bit.
- Removed Nexus 2M/4M/8M config options, dynamic RAM board autoconfig data modifications are now supported.
- Added Impulse FireCracker 24 display adapter emulation, single display mode only.
  (Display scaling and positioning incomplete and not all control register bits are known)
- Pixel perfect genlock transparency data is now available if configured display adapter needs it.
  (HAM-E and FireCracker 24) HAM-E end of display is now correctly detected.
- AVIOutput wave/avi mode and file name is stored in registry/ini.
- AVI recording A/V sync getting larger and larger fixed. Should be perfect now in all configurations.
- Tablet touch GUI open function really works now.

Beta 18: (Official in 2-3 weeks)

- Archos AVideo 24 emulation. Animation/doublebuffering feature not yet emulated.
  Note that AVideo 12 and 24 are not hardware compatible and it is also not AGA compatible, same
  $dff1fc custom register conflict. (A4000 version not yet emulated, compatible driver/install disk
  is MIA, latest available is v15 which was released long before A4000 version)
- Video DAC 18 and AVideo emulation now works correctly in Double, fields+ interlace mode.
- AVideo 12/24 mode autodetection supported.
- Improved 53C80 emulation.
- Trying to execute MODE SELECT SCSI command in low level scsi emulation mode worked strangely.
- Added C-Ltd A1000/A2000 SCSI controller.
- Added Preferred Technologies Nexus SCSI controller. Boot ROM added.
- Added Expansion Systems DataFlyer 1200/4000 SCSI+.
- GUI tab order fixed and updated.
- Don't disable Overlays in Filter panel if system has no shader support. Only Masks need it.
- Only take internal screenshot when entering GUI if mode is fullscreen DirectDraw. (Entering
  GUI can cause lost DD surface which would make Screenshot button useless). Delay when opening
  GUI in some systems should be gone now. (If not DD fullscreen).

C-Ltd A1000/A2000:
- 53C80 fake DMA.
- Non-autoboot, no ROM and no ROM socket.

Preferred Technologies Nexus:
- 53C80 fake DMA (word wide).
- Boot ROM is only a small driver loader, complete driver is stored in RDB's LSEG blocks!
- nexus.device, 1G drive size limit.
- Partition/formatter utility is strange..
- Has different Fast RAM autoconfig product ID depending on RAM size.

DataFlyer 1200/4000 SCSI+:
- Connects to A1200/A4000 IDE port, converts it to IDE + SCSI controller.
- 53C80 fake DMA (byte wide).
- No boot ROM, loadable driver only, can't boot from SCSI drive.
- Uses unused IDE control block registers to switch between IDE and 53C80 registers.

Beta 17:

- Restrict GUI IDE units to 2 if device is single port and without IDE doubler support.
- Added recursive ROM scan option to Paths panel. Currently restricted to 2 directory levels.
- HAM-E Plus average pixel calculation bug fixed in hires mode.
- "Direct" serial mode and Amiga serial receive buffer is full and program does not clear buffered byte before
  new byte arrives (uses emulated serial speed): keep waiting until program reads the buffered byte.
  Previously it was possible to lose received characters in some situations.
- Windows 10 TP hack (b13) removed, build 10061 fixed it. RIM_TYPEHID RawInput bug is also fixed in 10061.
- VGA autoresolution hires<>superhires switch was unreliable, it didn't set internal "config changed" variable.
- If DirectInput device acquire call fails 10 times, ignore the device and stop error logging until all devices
  needs to be re-acquired (for example focus is lost and regained or GUI is entered and exited)
- Entering ROM panel possible crash fixed.
- Newtronic Technologies Video DAC 18 RGB port video adapter emulation. (Format encoding information by mark_k)
- If programmable hsync or vsync enabled with out of range values: syncs stop, stop also CIA-A (if vsync timed)
  and/or CIA-B TOD counting.
- Archos AVideo 12 emulation. Denise adapter, not AGA compatible, can't be AGA compatible even in emulation due
  to custom chipset register conflict. (Information by mark_k)
- FBcc and FDBcc FPU instruction didn't work correctly in more compatible or cycle-exact modes.
- Negative boot priority value was parsed incorrectly when loading config file. Broken when manual HDF
  geometry support was added
- If system has built-in touch screen (for example Intel based Windows 8.1 tablet), >3s touch in top/left
  corner will open GUI. Added because previously it was impossible to enter GUI without external keyboard.
  Quick hack only, real touch support may or may not be implemented in future.
- Made "Double, fields" default for interlace mode.
- Added partial 53C400 SCSI chip emulation (53C400 = 53C80 + integrated buffered "fake" dma support +
  some PC single chip SCSI integration/compatibility features)
- Added Roctec RocHard RH800C SCSI emulation (53C400). Emulation is based on boot disk SCSI format utility
  behavior, for some reason disk loadable driver won't automount SCSI disks. v2.0 ROM is still MIA.
  IDE-only (SCSI chip not installed) and IDE+SCSI board subtypes added.
- Generate DSKSYN interrupt if DSKSYNC matches zero when DMA is started but before any bits gets
  transferred. Jukebox 2 / Dreamdealers accidentally (wrong INTREQR bit checked) requires it.

Beta 16:

- Automatic resize used horizontal zoom value for both horizontal and vertical.
- Replaced half-integer scaling options with separate select menu with 1/1, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 scaling options.
- Paths panel portable mode checkbox now switches between modes. NOTE: currently old data is not copied but
  created from scratch. Switching off portable mode automatically deletes winuae.ini. Switching on portable
  mode does not delete registry data.
- Graffiti/HAM-E mode switch does not anymore change display position.
- Added HAM-E Plus emulation. (Probably not correct implemention, currently uses simple average calculation
  to create extra pixel between each "normal" HAM-E pixel)
- Added separate waiting for connection TCP serial option. Old option does not wait anymore.
- Fixed 7-bit serial bytes in serial logging/TCP modes (Stop bit=bit7 was not cleared)
- Added Roctec RocHard RH800C emulation. rtidedisk.device, 1.0 ROM added which is IDE-only. First port is
  IDE unit 0, second port is IDE unit 2. Ports are not shared and master-only.

Beta 15:

- Map only upper half of ROM image if GVP Series II ROM is 32k.
- HD controller ROM loader duplicate code removal from HD controller specific code.
- Accelerator board HD controller hardware was not added to emulation if board's boot ROM was missing. (b12)
- Added DKB 12x0 accelerator on-board RAM support. 1M and 2M size are not supported, address mapping is
  not completely emulated.
- Floppy sound volume mixing fixed (b14).
- Oktagon 2008 didn't have autoboot disable option.
- Only keep high Windows timer resolution mode active when emulation is running.
- Added Seek (6) and (10) SCSI commands to HD SCSI emulator, only checks for valid LBA.
- VGA modes had inverted TV/VGA aspect ratio setting. (Probably not completely correct yet)
- Added configurable blanking borders. GUI adjustment hacked to Filter panel, "Overscan blanking" setting.
  When "Overscan blanking" is selected, filter mode is always none. First slider adjusts horizontal start,
  second = horizontal end, third = vertical start, fourth = vertical end. Values are always in superhires
  (horizontal) and interlaced (vertical) coordinates. Zero = disabled.
  Currently display is only updated with new values after returning to emulation and GUI text elements are
  not changed.

Beta 14:

- Show selected accelerator board and HD controller name(s) in log lines.
- GVP Series I and II HD controllers can now be active at the same time.
- Added SCSI controller ID selection (only AdSCSI and A4091 supported so far)
- Mark HD controllers with * if it is enabled, becomes [x] if more than 1 controller is active.
- Fixed referencing to already freed SCSI/IDE HD controller context structure after reset/restart (b12)
- Added SupraDrive AMAB3, AMAB4 and AMAB5 ROMs.
- NCR539x based SCSI controllers always accessed unit 0.
- Added emulation of edge case when SPRxPOS or SPRxCTL vertical position is updated at the last available dma slot
  at the end of scanline. Next line's vertical comparison will match just before this position, in other words, if
  old value would match in next line and new value does not anymore, comparison match still happens. Fixes
  Arc Ed / United Forces missing sprite scroller.
- Added half-integer scaling option. (*0.5, *1.0, *1.5 and so on)
- New Velvet prototype difference found: both CIAs generate level 2 interrupt. Now Velvet tries to boot from
  disk, reads and executes boot block code if disk has correct bootblock which is different than release AmigaOS
  bootblock. MFM level format seems to be identical. Unfortunately, at least so far, no original Velvet floppy
  disks have been found and for some reason real hardware refuses to read any disks.
- If -serlog is enabled, console log window also listens for key codes and sends them to emulated serial
  port. Very basic console emulator, enables quick use of Velvet ROM built-in serial debugger.
- Added "Any floppy drive" option to keyboard led configuration.
- Floppy sound volume control is not global anymore. Empty and disk in drive states also have separate volume
  settings. (Upper volume slider = drive empty, lower slider = disk in drive)
- Added fullscreen GUI option to misc panel. Opens GUI in max size, possibly useful with low resolution devices
  and/or small Windows tablets.
- Z3 autoconfig in "UAE" mode didn't work correctly with hardware RTG boards (b4)

Beta 13:

- Mainboard SCSI controllers didn't initialize correctly (A3000/A4000T/CDTV) (b12)
- "Do not force full display reset.." update made it worse, should be better now (b12)
- I finally bothered to carefully re-examine AR3 freezer behavior, emulation updated, should now match real
  hardware, previously unsupported features like autofire work.
- If copper DMA is switched off mid-instruction, allow instruction to finish. Fixes AR2 weird copper
  list detection code.
- Added RDB mode HD geometry GUI support. (RDB mode geometry option = what IDE Identify Device and SCSI
  MODE SENSE Format Parameters/Rigid Disk Geometry returns). Very old controllers may require custom geometry.
- Added HD/CF IDE harddrive GUI option. Currently only difference is in IDE Identify Device word 0 identifier.
  (Cause for infamous hdtoolbox "Unit is not a disk (Type 7)" error)
- Added GUI IDE and SCSI version selection to hardfile panel. IDE has ATA-1, ATA-2+ (old default, returns ATA-6
  to allow LBA48 support and more) and ATA-2+ Strict which drops ATA-1 feature that become optional in ATA-2,
  triggering A600/A1200/A4000 IDE driver bug that causes infamous "max transfer bug". (No, it isn't drive bug)
  SCSI has SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 options. Currently only real difference is INQUIRY version number, some old
  software (like original A590/A2091 install disk) require SCSI-1 version.
- Added Archos ADD-500 emulation.
- Added AdSCSI Advantage 2000 emulation.
- Internal enforcer emulation hit can break to debugger, enable/disable with 'fen' debugger command.
- SCSI Read Defect Data command: return empty defect header instead of Defect List Not Found error.
  (ADD-500 driver gets confused if Read Defect Data command does not return any data)
- WD33C93 SCSI devices didn't support multiple units (b12)
- Added hack that fixes max overscan scrolling in demo Seven Seas / Andromeda. (Demo has workaround for chipset
  bug that causes right edge to have a vertical gap if BPLCON1 is larger than zero. Hack is currently needed
  because glitch happens when hpos=0 and emulation is not designed to handle bitplane changes that cross virtual
  scanlines). Glitch was not emulated until few versions ago, demo worked only accidentally previously.
- Added Windows 10 TP bug workaround, for some reason dialog window is visible before WM_INITDIALOG message
  (documentation specifically says it won't be visible until after WM_INITDIALOG) and also dialog is set
  as not visible. Fixes quickly appearing and disappering empty WinUAE GUI panel each time GUI is opened.

AdSCSI Advantage 2000:
- 5380 based fake DMA.
- First 5380 based driver that uses chip's arbitrate bit instead of assuming AdSCSI is the only initiator.
- 1.6 ROM added. (Anyone have later? At least 1.9 exists)
- RDB parser is not fully compatible, does not load all filesystems (for example PFS3).

Archos ADD-500:
- Yet another 5380 based fake DMA SCSI controller.
- v1.21 ROM added.

Beta 12:

- Do not force full display reset when switching to/from programmed mode and autoresolution is active
  and mode is D3D. (D3D can switch display buffer size without closing existing window)
- Added config file option to force UAE boot ROM active even if current configuration does not need it.
  boot_rom_uae=automatic/disabled/min/full. automatic (or line not included)=normal default, disabled=always
  disabled (all features that require uae boot rom stop working), min=only add old-style $F0FFxx traps).
- Serial port emulation (if connected to real serial port) lost characters if transmit speed was fast enough.
  Broken since 2810b4.
- Raw SCSI emulation improvements and updates.
- WD33C93 emulation didn't allow use of select and transfer to split single transfer in multiple pieces.
- Kupke Golem SCSI emulation.
- Microbotics A1000 StarBoard 2 StarDrive SCSI expansion board emulation.
- J.Kommos A500 SCSI emulation, 1.8 rom added. 
- Vector Falcon 8000 emulation. ROM created from disk based driver.
- M-Tec AT 500 emulation.
- Protar A500 HD emulation.
- Added AdIDE 40/44 emulation.
- Masoboshi SCSI read access works again, writes are still broken. (Driver is strange, it uses code path
  that simply can't work, writes 16 extra bytes. There is another code path that looks correct but there
  are lots of unknown variables that are set here and there..)
- Kupke Golem 030 A500 accelerator and boot rom added ("68030 Autoconfig (17-FEB-91) V1.0 ET")
- Added manufacturer names to HD controller selection.
- Reorganized internal accelerator board handling.
- GVP Series I ROM and buffer RAM mirrors now 100% match real hardware.
- Memwatch points didn't work with autoconfig address bank.
- Refactored expansion board handling yet again, multiple identical boards are supported again.
- Added GUI support for multiple identical HD controller boards. Current max is 4 boards.
- Selecting some accelerator ROM file (for example CS MK I and II) also added it to cart rom file.
- Show only mainboard HD controllers and enabled (ROM selected) expansion controllers in HD controller
  selection list. (CDTV and some others are not yet hidden, much more work to do, later..)
- Added "Velvet" A1000 prototype to chipset selection. Floppy IO lines are not hooked to CIA chips
  correctly, probably lots of other minor changes that are not known yet are not emulated.
- Show floppy image's original file name in status bar even if file needed decompression or converting.

Microbotics StarDrive SCSI:
- A1000 StarBoard 2 RAM expansion optional HD controller module.
- Text based partitioning software.
- 5380 based, no autoboot ROM, no RDB support.
- Clock not emulated.

M-Tec AT 500:
- 1.33 ROM added. "mtec-at500.device mtec-at500 1.33w (08 July 1993)"
  "(c) Hardware Design Udo Neuroth, Bottrop, Dieter Niewerth, 1992 1993"

AdIDE:
- 68000 socket.
- Uses custom data bit swapping (drive partitioned with AdIDE won't work in any other IDE controller and
  vice versa), emulation will automatically read/write non-swapped data.
- Uses RDB but does not seem to be fully compatible, other controller partitioned drives don't mount.
- ROM was software dumped, real chip probably has swapped address or data lines similar to IDE data lines.

Kupke Golem SCSI:
- Fake dma interface.
- Tested with 3.8 and 3.9 drivers. 3.9 rom added.

Protar A500 HD:
- ROM only has small loader code, loads driver from HD. (If drive is unformatted, press mouse button
  to boot from floppy)
- 8490 chip (improved version of 5380). 8490 extra features not emulated, at least Protar driver does
  not use them.
- ROM added, unknown version. There probably is later version because only 1.4 (1.x?) boot disks
  detect the hardware.

J.Kommos A500 SCSI:
- Strange non-autoconfig autobooting HD controller, uses cartridge ROM space.
- Byte-based fake dma.
- Boot HD detection screen.
- Not RDB compatible.
- ROM includes 36.3 FastFileSystem handler.
- jkscsi.device, "Autoboot SCSI-HardDisk By J.Kommos Date: 25.07.1990".

Vector Falcon 8000:
- Improved version of Kommos SCSI.
- More or less functionally same as Kommos but most glue TTL chips and GALs put in single FPGA-like chip.
- Long word/word based fake DMA.
- More colorful boot HD detection screen.
- vector.device. "Autoconfig 16 Bit SCSI + CD-ROM Driver (©) by J.Kommos V7.1 - 11.08.1993"
- ROM includes CD ROM filesystem.
- Bad filesystem loader: must be single hunk, only loads filesystems if KS 1.3, ignores all relocation
  hunks.

Beta 11:

- Supra HD autoconfig state was not reset when system was reset.
- 68000 bus/address error stack frame I/N bit emulated, added better check for odd stack in exception stack frame
  writes. Also added helpers for bus error checks for platforms that need it (UAE 68k emulator is also used by
  Hatari) I don't know any program (or protection) that uses it but crashing/buggy programs may trigger it.
- Show also currently selected accelerator board in harddrive controller selection.
- Toccata capture support, not tested. Uses WASAPI (=Vista or newer only) and uses Windows default
  recording device, not configurable yet. First tries to allocate exclusive mode, if it fails, retries with
  shared mode. Note that only exclusive mode allows configurable sampling frequency, shared uses value set in
  Windows recording sound control panel.
- Tweaked A590/A2091 DMAC interrupt handling and DMAC-01 DMA transfer counter emulation.
- Added Kupke Golem v3.9 ROM image, not emulated, Golem does not use any SCSI chips, it is very
  difficult to guess function of each IO address.
- CDTV SCSI works again, broke when A2090 support was added.
- A26x0 J304 jumper emulation fixed. It should not be active anymore after autoconfig io gets enabled.
- Added rare SupraDrive 2000 DMA emulation. Boot ROM are not available, some supra install disks have on-disk
  loadable driver which has bug in 2000 DMA model specific code that causes it to hang (uses wrong address
  register, overwrites one inportant byte in interrupt handler code..) Perfect.
  AMAB6 ROM is selectable in rom select box but it is not compatible with 2000 DMA.
  (Thanks to mark_k for HD driver disassembling and examination)
- Non-image CD last available block number calculation changed, do not trust geometry Windows returns.
  (Fixes OS41FE install error)
- Fixed OS41FE RTG graphics mode switch crash. (Check Cirrus Logic VRAM bounds before calling redraw routines,
  apparently driver first switches mode, then sets new display offset, this can cause temporary out of bounds
  access in emulation)

Beta 10:

- Added hd controller subtype selection.
- A590/A2091: DMAC-01/02 revision selection.
- GVP Series I: all revisions.
- Remaining non-DMA SupraDrives added.
- Masoboshi MC-302 (IDE-only) and MC-702 (IDE+SCSI). Note that only MC-302 is currently working, DMA also not
  yet supported. (Driver by default uses only PIO)
- Added A2090/A2090a emulation.
  (Currently shared with A590/A2091, it is not possible to use A2090 and A590/A2091 at the same time)
- Previous supradrive config entry name changed, config reset needed.
- A590/A2091 interrupt handling updates.
- 68000 address error stacked PC accuracy improved (MOVEM and NOT, CLR and other single operand instructions)
- Apparently GVP Series I Z2 RAM autoconfig id is 1761/8.
- Accelerator board without IDE and SCSI and SCSI (auto) or IDE (auto) selected: drive was incorrectly reserved
  for selected accelerator board.
- Reorganized accelerator board handling, built-in HD controller configuration source code special cases removed.
  ROM selection shows only ROM images compatible with selected accelerator board.
- Added accelerator rom config/jumper options. Currently only map rom for Blizzards (ROM panel MapROM emulation
  still also selects it) and OSMODE (J304) jumper for A26x0.
- WD33C93 emulation fix, A2630+A2090 Amix installation works.
- "24-bit address space is not supported with selected accelerator board configuration" error even when 24-bit
  was not enabled.
- Bogus 0x20 68882 stack frame version id removed, both 68881 and 68882 use 0x1f.
- Set/reset accelerator ROM correctly in Quickstart mode.
- Debugger fl was already reserved for listing active break points. Scanline fl renamed to fs.
- Debugger library and device list commands (Td, Tl) shows version, revision, opencount and id string.
- Debugger task list command (Tt) shows signals that task is waiting for and PC where task continues executing
  when Wait() returns. Also previously it showed extra bogus entry and usually also didn't show all tasks..
- Added extra prefetch hack for A26x0 ROM off switch code if 68030 MMU is enabled.
- On the fly switching from AGA to non-AGA mode didn't reset FMODE value.

A2090(a):

- Commodore's first Amiga harddrive controller and it shows..
- Custom partition table (No RDB), autoboot is supported.
- Very confusing and illogical partitioning system. (No, double clicking "Prep HD" icon won't do what
  you would expect it to do. At least with SCSI-only configuration.)
- 34.4 boot ROM added.
- At least 34.4 has broken format routine (few absolute addresses are not relocated correctly in rom code)
  for SCSI drives. Disable boot ROM and use binddrivers mounting when running prep-program as a workaround.
- ST-506 parts not emulated.

GVP Series I:
- Impact A2000-1/X (Autoconfig Product number 1)
- Impact A2000-HC (Product 2)
- Impact A2000-HC+2 (Product 3)
- Nearly identical hardware. Different SRAM buffer size and SRAM address offset.
- Early partition software created incompatible RDB blocks. (For example checksum fields are zeroed)
- v1.0 (1.16 driver version) ROM added.

SupraDrives:
- A500 ByteSync/XP (was already supported since b8)
- 2000 WordSync
- A500 Autoboot
- 4x4 (Non autoboot). Clock chip not yet emulated.
- Supra AMABx ROMs support all above models.
- All Supradrives except very rare 2000 DMA (which apparently had bad DMA implementation and uses
  very different driver) are now emulated.

Beta 9:

- Fixed harddrive config parse crash. (b8)
- Blizzard SCSI Kit was always enabled if compatible accelerator board was selected. (b8)
- Accelerator board with SCSI and "IDE (auto)": HD was mounted as accelerator SCSI. (b8)
- Accelerator board ROM selection is not anymore in SCSI/Boot ROM list.
- Added autoboot disabled jumper option to harddrive controllers. Not all devices supported yet.
  (Some only hardware disable rom chip, some change autoconfig data in hardware level)

Beta 8:

- 53c710 software reset bit emulated.
- Cirrus Logic register memory banks should not be marked thread safe.
- Show '?' instead of 'E' in harddrives list if hdf can't be opened because of access fault, for example if it
  is already open and emulation is running and show '!' if open failed because of write protection.
- Rewritten expansion board rom handling, expansion data is now fully parametrized, autoconfig emulation and
  config file handling does not need code changes anymore when new board with boot rom is implemented.
- Secondary IDE/SCSI boards temporarily removed.
- Automatically disable 24-bit CPU addressing if selected accelerator board is 32-bit.
- Existing Blizzard 1230IV/1240/1260+SCSI configurations need adjustment. SCSI Kit configuration has changed.
- Do not initialize tablet if tablet options are not enabled.
- 5380/53c80 SCSI chip emulation implemented. Surprisingly basic chip, even Apollo SCSI hardware is more complex,
  driver needs even more bit-banging than Apollo..
- SupraDrive 500XP (5380) emulation implemented.
- Added GVP G-Force 030 board. Same as GVP A530 but supports more RAM, located at 0x01000000.
- A2620/A2630 accelerator board RAM now adjusts 0x01000000 memory size.
- Fixed GPV Series I autoconfig product id.
- STOP instruction was 2 cycles too fast in 68000 cycle-exact mode.

NOTE: Accelerator board ROM appears also in SCSI/Boot ROM list. It will be removed later.

SupraDrive 500XP:

- v3.8 ROM (AMAB6) added. (Anyone have AMAB5 or older? I'd like to know why older versions have so many
  compatibility problems with modern drives. A2000 WordSync version also accepted.)
- Uses MOVEP in main data transfer loop. (My crystall ball says WordSync version does not...)
- Usual fake DMA, CPU used to transfer data, hardware automatically handles SCSI data handshake.
- Any CPU access to "fake DMA" address space when SCSI chip is not in DMA mode: access never finishes.
  This is also emulated, causes halt 6 state.

Beta 7:

- Fixed infinite recursion (and stack overflow) when pause when uncaptered is enabled and display mode changes.
- Added AlfaPower/AT-BUS 508/2008/AlfaPower Plus IDE controller.
- Very simple low level SCSI emulator added to support Apollo software bit-banging SCSI.
- Added Apollo IDE/SCSI board (AT500/AT2008) and Apollo 1240/1260 accelerator boards with SCSI.
- Added GVP Series I SCSI controller.
- Added GVP A530 accelerator. Uses same boot ROM as GVP Series II SCSI controllers. (Uses GVP #2 SCSI slot)
- Added Masoboshi MC-702 IDE+SCSI controller.
- Toccata CD audio (AUX1) volume control added.
- Another Restart related crash fix.
- Added "framecounter" float shader variable.
- Paths panel Save All button now creates zip file that contains winuaebootlog.txt, winuaelog.txt and config file.
- Quickstart A1200 + accelerator board, A500+ and A600 with expansion never had RTC. (Wrong order of functions..)
- Possible clock sync option small stability improvement.
- Fixed memory corruption if directory harddrive with empty name was selected.

SCSI/IDE controller notes:

GVP Series I:
- Not true DMA, DMA transfers from WD to/from onboard SRAM buffer. CPU needed to read/write buffer ram.
- Driver (scsidev.device) is very old and has (many?) limits, for example only OFS and FFS partitions mount correctly.

AlfaPower/AT-Bus 508/2008/AlfaPower Plus:
- AlfaPower: no hardware interrupt (!!), AlfaPower Plus implements interrupt support.
- v6.10 ROM (Last that works with non-Plus hardware?) and v8.3 that requires Plus.

Apollo:
- All Apollo variants seems to have identical SCSI hardware. (Accelerators and 500/2000)
- SCSI is working. IDE is not fully tested, only AT500/AT2000 have full IDE driver. For some reason
  Apollo 1240/1260 driver still have short "is there any IDE drives" detection code remaining.
- "Software" SCSI, hardware can only do bus arbitration in hardware, everything else is done by bit-banging
  SCSI IO lines. Both SCSI and IDE also use non-DMA data transfers.
- 128k Apollo ROMs (68060 f00000 ROM code and SCSI driver) are currently supported. Non-accelerator
  (AT500/AT2000) ROMs don't seem to be available = can't test IDE emulation.
- 128k v5.60 ROM added. Seems to be last 1240/1260 ROM with SCSI.

Masoboshi:
- Unusual design, SCSI supports both PIO and DMA, software selectable.
- IDE and SCSI in non-DMA mode working.
- SCSI writes are not working correctly, do not use! DMA controller not yet emulated.
- "2.201" (device version) boot ROM added. ROM image does not have any version numbers or dates.
- IDE driver uses CHS addressing and seems to have problems with 2G drives, actual limit may be smaller.
  It tries to access first unavailable block number at the end of drive. (Driver flashes red background
  color if drive returns error status)

Most popular SCSI and IDE controllers are now implemented.
Remaining IDE boards that I'd like to support:
- Roctec RocHard (Need boot ROM)
- AdIDE 40/44 (Need boot ROM)
Remaining SCSI boards are 5380/53c80 based boards that need chip emulation first:
- All SupraDrives.
- Trumpcard 500/2000

Perhaps others too. As long as at least one boot ROM is found for unsupported boards.

Beta 6:

- b5 input device update fix, changing to any keyboard layout didn't reset "remembered" device name.
- Cycle at DDFSTRT-1 was sometimes incorrectly unavailable for blitter. (b5)
- In some rare situations blitter stole cycle(s) from copper.
- Pre-calculated end position of scanline was incorrect in some situations causing incorrect bitplane
  vs other DMA cycle allocation (b5)
- If RawInput didn't find any game controller HID devices and command line didn't have any forced HID parameters,
  always try again when new device is inserted instead of disabling HID support completely and falling back to
  DirectInput. RawInput and DirectInput device identifiers are different and wrong device may have been selected
  in some situations.
- Master volume is now real master volume control. Paula, CD and AHI are sub-volume controls.
- Toccata Paula (AUX2 input) volume control implemented. Not tested.
- GVP SCSI without ROM didn't set any autoconfig data.
- Fastlane (and possibly some other Z3 SCSI boards) didn't autoconfigure if Z3 autoconfig space was disabled.

Beta 5:

- Fixed ESP SCSI DMA emulation bug I introduced when non-DMA mode support was added (Original code from QEMU was DMA-only)
- Nordic Power v3.2 and Pro Access v2.17 (early version of cartridge that become Action Replay 1) support added.
- Some chipset emulation tweaks. Strange bitplane DMA on/off mid scanline behavior now emulated, not sure if exactly
  right yet. Also some strange OCS/ECS differences tweaked. Should be mostly finished now.
  I'll post more details later.
- Some tweaks to writing to BPLxPT 1 cycle before BPL DMA fetches same bitplane. Nakudemo / Vision-X ECS only corruption
  is now correct (and also looks much worse than previously).
- GVP SCSI WD33C93 transfer info command with DMA enabled was not working.
- Compressed flashable rom images didn't unpack automatically. Flash modifications are not saved if using compressed image.
- Remember original input device name when loading config and input device is not currently available. If/when input
  device gets connected, device is automatically inserted in to originally configured port. Remembered name is "forgotten"
  when input device is manually changed in GUI or if autoswitching is used.

Beta 4:

- HAM-E images updated only every other line in doubled modes.
- Graffiti didn't sync correctly if config was not AGA.
- Restart button crashed if hardware RTG was enabled.
- PCMCIA IDE didn't work anymore (b2)
- .pkd file extension inside archive wasn't autodetected.
- Disk/CD insert status message file name was shown as "null" if file was inside archive root.
- HD and tape SCSI emulation unsupported LUN sense data was overwritten with default ILLEGAL FIELD IN CDB sense data.
- CD SCSI emulator didn't check for non-zero LUNs.
- Return SCSI-1 HD inquiry data only if A590/A2091.
- Show also REQUEST SENSE command and data if scsi emulation logging is enabled.
- 68000 prefetch mode DIVS/DIVU timing update didn't work, always returned 4 cycles due to missing parenthesis.
- Switching chip ram and/or slow ram size usually crashed after reset if ECS Agnus was selected.
- Some very old statefiles had Z2 fast ram with zeroed autoconfig address, added workaround (broke during 2.9 betas)
- Added fl <lines to wait> or fl <absolute line> <absolute hpos> and fc <CCKs to wait> break points to debugger.
- Z3 space memory mapping was not initialized if only non-RAM/VRAM Z3 expansions are configured.
- Clock sync feature update, previously only 50Hz CIA-A TOD rate was fully accurate.
- Load CDTV/CD32 state file, load other state file: CDTV/CD32 CD was still mounted.
- Yet another bitplane DMA sequencer emulation rewrite and cleanups. Still some bitplane DMA on/off switch edge cases remaining
  Switch on bitplane DMA near end the scanline: following line starts DMA for one "block" only, next line works normally.
  This needs more real hardware testing to find exact conditions.
- Source cleanup, moved all kinds of device init/free/interrupt check codes to common file from non-related source
  files.
- Added name to UAE Boot ROM DiagArea. (May be visible in some system info/diagnostics software)
- HALT status was not cleared when loading new state file.

Beta 3:

- Bitplane DMA sequencer emulation rewritten yet again to again match better with real hardware behavior.
  DDFSTRT and DDFSTOP seems to use hidden counter that counts 4 cycles ahead of real hpos counter.
  When DDFSTRT matches, next 4 cycles appears to be idle (probably used to init and fill some bitplane dma
  sequencer shift register?) and after this delay DMA starts normally. Same for stop. Now programs that write to
  DDFSTRT or DDFSTOP just before, exactly in same cycle or just after it should match now just work without
  any extra hacks. (Some kind of 4 stage shift register would also explain why changing number of bitplanes by
  writing to BPLCON0 mid-line always take effect after exactly 4 cycle delay)
  Can break anything as usual! Correctly breaks SCX_CoolSpot1.adf's intro on ECS Agnus configurations :)
- 512k chip + 512k slow ram + ECS Agnus chip mirroring didn't set slow ram bank with "no memory allocated" flag,
  could have caused crashes when it was attempted to be freed.
- OCS Agnus 512k chip + 512k+ slow and 1M/0.5+0.5 advanced chipset checkbox checked: move slow ram start at $080000.
- 68000 bus error and address error exception stack frame's first word undocumented bits 6 to 15 seem to contain
  opcode of faulted instruction. (from Hatari)
- IDE/ATAPI emulation decoupled from Gayle emulation and moved to separate source file.
- Added GVP A3001 board with IDE. Apparently Series I and II have different hardware and drivers. (v4 for Series II)
  Series I IDE emulation seems to be fully working. Non-DMA, gvpat.device, v3.3 added to ROM scanner.
  Does not byte swap data words but emulation swaps it automatically to keep HDFs compatible with other controllers.
- Added ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED flag to SetThreadExecutionState(), perhaps it keeps screensaver inactive.
  (ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED seems to only make sure monitor does not switch to power saving mode)
- HAM-E emulation added. Because HAM-E "magic cookie" can be nearly anywhere on screen, enabling HAM-E will slow down
  emulation (It needs to check nearly all pixels every frame) even when HAM-E mode is not active. "Automatic" setting
  still only does A2024 and Graffiti detection. DCTV emulation: not going happen without image encoding specs.

Beta 2:

- Paula audio filter still filtered Toccata audio. Note that stereo separation is after Toccata audio
  mixing.
- Added "ROM disabled" to GVP SCSI ROM selection.
- GVP SCSI ROM space word reads accessed invalid memory.
- Added Paths panel option to store "saveimages" in same directory as original image file, instead of always
  saving in saveimages-directory, extension changed to .save_adf to prevent it being visible in directory
  listings with normal disk image filter type active.
- 68030 MMU on the fly off->on switch crashed. (Not that on the fly MMU switching is really supported..)
- WD33C93 Select without ATN command didn't fully skip message out phase. (AMAX GVP SCSI driver)
- Reading WD33C93 SCSI message in with Transfer Info command is a special case, after it finishes, it does
  not advance to next state automatically, it must wait for Negate ACK command. (AMAX GVP SCSI driver)
- AMAX rom "dongle" emulation improved floppy drives didn't work reliably.
- Added AMAX rom image selection to ROM panel SCSI select menu, renamed to SCSI/Boot ROMs.
- Added very simple next opcode word prefetch emulation to 68030 MMU mode, only done when MMU state changes.
  Fixes programs that first switch on (or off) MMU which also unmaps memory where currently executing code
  is located and then executes JMP (An).
- Added Toccata recording support, currently only internal hardware emulation is implemented (FIFO and interrupts),
  returns only zero samples.
- Show also inserted data CD volume id (label) in status bar, strip path from file name.
- Show inserted floppy image filename and label (if OFS/FFS image) in status bar.
- CD image audio can be now mixed with Paula audio, just like Toccata output. CD audio can be finally recorded
  with internal wave or avi recording support (Requested feature). FPS.Adj also adjusts CD audio speed (and pitch)
  and CD audio sound sync (For example Liberation CD32 intro) is kept even if emulation slows down.
  Enable option added to Sound panel (can be switched on the fly but mode only changes when CD audio thread restarts),
  old method is still the default. Note: when enabled, Paula audio slider becomes master volume for CD audio.
- CD32 FMV also supports new audio mixing mode. FPS.Adj not supported yet.

Beta 1:

- Lowered disk motor startup delay, more closer match with real hardware (at least matches some random drive
  in my A500)
- Memwatch points in KS ROM address space crashed during reset. (Wrong ROM mirror selection)
- A4000T NCR SCSI data bus width become 16-bit in cycle-exact mode. Caused write triggerable registers
  to start operation before full 32-bit value was written.
- Memwatch points didn't work in ROM addresses.
- CPU HALT state caused infinite loop in some configurations.
- 2900b16 68040 MMU MOVEM stack frame update was incorrect. (NetBSD crash, probably other Unix-likes too)
- Some 68000 MOVE variants seem to sample interrupt lines before writes and some after writes. Added special
  case for one variant, allows Made in Croatia / Binary to work in cycle-exact mode. Need more testing later,
  there does not seem to be any pattern.
- Last line sometimes flickered with random colors in "Double, fields/+" non-interlaced mode.
- RTG mode screenshots in 16-bit host color depth mode had wrong colors.
- Non-cycle exact modes with display vertical diw open but bitplane DMA disabled: in some situations display was
  corrupted or shifted. (Gloom AGA, Worms Directors Cut title screens)
- Directory filesystem exnext packet update didn't always work correctly if file was deleted during directory
  enumeration. (Which is technically illegal but it accidentally worked with OFS/FFS and become a feature..)
- Autoconfig space was not unmapped after it finished, broke during previous autoconfig rewrite.
- GUI didn't allow selection of custom SCSI ROM file.
- Completely rewritten CPU idle function, max CPU idle setting should now work without any slowdown side-effects,
  also lowest CPU idle state should be less than 10%. Please test.
- Last line is not special if A1000 Agnus. I was expecting this result when I noticed that A1000 sprite behavior
  is different in last line vs later Agnus models. A1000 Agnus: all visible lines are normal, later revisions:
  last line inhibits bitplane and sprite DMA. Real A1000 confirmed. I think this is last A1000 vs later Agnus
  revision undocumented difference.
- Small sprite update, only writes to SPRxCTL disarms sprite (I had special case for first DMA write to SPRxPOS
  too, only because it worked around another old bug..). Now OCS Agnus + ECS Denise + KS3.1 combination mouse
  cursor sprite corruption is 100% correct.
- On the fly media insertions are now serialized and only processed when Windows PnP manager reports idle
  state (Media mounting works even if it causes "installing drivers" phase) and multiple simultaneous media
  insertions also work reliably now (for example USB reader connected with multiple cards already inserted)
- First on the fly inserted device name becomes RDH0:, second RDH1: and so on. Previously number was next
  available directory filesystem unit number.
- Delay enumeration of inserted/removed input devices by 2 seconds. One removal or insertion can cause
  multiple device events (which is harmless but sometimes annoying)
- Picasso IV autoconfig missed special case, other boards are 16M in Z3 mode but PIV is 32M. Fixes incorrect
  address alignment if Z3 fast RAM is also enabled and size is less than 32M. (OS4 black screen hang)
- Picasso IV byteswap VRAM space didn't handle byte reads or writes correctly, only words and longs worked.
  (OS4 1024*768*16 screen mode glitches, possibly also other 16 bit modes)

New hardware emulated:

- GVP SCSI Series I and II hardware emulation (WD33C93), HC+8 board. v3.15 and v4.15 boot ROMs added to ROM
  scanner (gvpscsi.device). GVP SCSI enabled + Z2 fast RAM: use GVP Z2 fast ram autoconfig ID.
- DKB 1230/1240 accelerator board + SCSI emulation (FAS246 which appears to be compatible with 53C94/FAS216).
  SCSI is non-DMA (dkbscsi.device). v1.23 ROM added to ROM scanner. RAM not emulated, no idea about address space.
- Fusion Forty accelerator board emulation. It has interesting menu and graphics in boot ROM, press right
  mouse button when booting. v3.4 ROM images added to ROM scanner. RAM expansion emulated.
- Toccata Z2 sound card emulation.

Toccata hardware features emulated:
- Mono and stereo channel modes.
- 8-bit and 16-bit linear PCM. Companded (ulaw/alaw) modes are not supported.
- Left and right output channel volume control and mute.
- All AD1848 supported output frequencies.
- Output only. Input channels are not supported.

Technical details:
- Has 1024x9bit FIFO chip, one for output and one for input.
- No DMA. Uses level 6 interrupt to fill FIFO, 512 bytes/interrupt. Interrupt triggers when FIFO has 512 bytes or less
  data available. (Which makes about 7 interrupts/frame at 44100Hz/16bit/stereo)

Notes:
- Different implementation than uae ahi and CD audio. Audio goes to Paula emulation backend (after Paula 8 to 16-bit
  conversions and filters). Very good latency but glitches are possible if configured buffer size is too small or
  not enough CPU power available (just like with Paula audio). It should be usable for (game) sound effect, not just
  for music.
- Because it uses Paula audio path, Toccata audio is included with sound recording. Same method may be used with
  CD audio in future. (Possibly optionally).
- It is best to set same sample rate in both AHI and UAE sound settings to reduce possible resampling artifacts.
- Does any DMA capable simple sound cards exist? (Simple = basic CODEC chip only, no DSP chip)
