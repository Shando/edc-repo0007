(24/02/2000) Changes Gens 0.2 <- Gens 0.141 :
---------------------------------------------

- I've entirely rewritten the VDP rendering :
  - More optimized and so faster ;)
  - Fixed Scroll A / Window conflict.
  - Added masks sprite features.
  - Added sprite limit feature (can see it on sonic 1 main screen)
    You can enable or disable it by 'Sprite Over' option in the 'graphics' menu.
  - Added 15 bits mode.
    No more bad colors on some video cards :)
- Fixed the VSRam read and write (vertical scrollings are now okay)
- I'm using RAZE (Richard Mitton richard.mitton@bigfoot.com) z80 emulator instead of MZ80
 (Neil Bradley neil@synthcom.com) due to unworking games with MZ80 (I may not use it correctly).
- Some changes in DMA transfers. (sprites of mario (no commercial) rom are okay).
- Full-Screen now works correctly.
  Full-Screen is faster than Windowed mode, just use it !
- Some others ...

Sorry, once again, the sound is not implemented, may be in the next release !
