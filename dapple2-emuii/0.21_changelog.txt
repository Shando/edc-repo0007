Changes from 0.20 to 0.21
-------------------------
  * BUGFIX: my replacement of hex8tostringf() was incorrect.  PEBKAC run
    wild. (-uso.)
  * Fixed bugs where certain flags were changed when they should not be.
  * Added foreign character support and Mousetext.
  * Added option to blur text in graphics modes (like ApplePC and SimSystem
    IIe, and as on the real machine).  Also added more realistic blurry
    graphics mode.
  * BUGFIX (Font): Mousetext character for Z was one pixel too far right; so
    it was not being drawn.
  * Cosmetic tweaks.
