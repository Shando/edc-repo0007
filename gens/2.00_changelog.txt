  Note that contrast and brightness are not calculated correctly yet.
* Rewritten Gens.txt by Red5 of the Genesis Project. This is
  intended to be an updated/improved version of the old Gens.txt, it is not
  a "Gens Manual Lite" however and you will still need to download that for
  instructions on some of the more advanced features like Game Genie support.
* Debug removed.
* Screens saver is disable when Gens is running.
* Modified the tiny application icon, the guy which sent me it will probably 
  recognize it ;)
