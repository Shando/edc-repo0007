(27/03/2000) Changes Gens 0.36 <- Gens 0.34 :
---------------------------------------------

- Gens now uses the new MZ80 core of Neil Bradley (v3.4)
  and it corrects some sound bugs !
- Fixed special version auto-detection (Toy Story ...)
- SRAM implemented (Landstaker, Light Crusader ... now work correctly !)
  but not yet saved in a file.
- Choice of the game speed added : NTSC (60 FPS) or PAL (50 FPS).
  If a game runs too fast, just switch to PAL version.
- Sound timing for some games (vector man ...) fixed.
- Fixed switch state shortcut.
- Fixed the stupid bug which exits after setting keys !
- Fixed load state crashes with starscream.
- ...

Joystick support not yet available :(
