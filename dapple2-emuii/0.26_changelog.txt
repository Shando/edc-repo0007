Changes from 0.25 to 0.26
-------------------------
  * Tweaked the font; if and when the code is adjusted, Mousetext can be
    switched from the original version to the later version.
  * Blurry lo-res graphics option.
  * Option to offset dots by 1/2 "pixel" in hi-res mode when the high-order
    bit is set, as the ][ and ][+ did.
  * Added some of the NMOS 6502 illegal opcodes.
  * Dapple ][ is now "officially" bilingual (English/German) although not
    all messages have been translated.
  * Support for the AppleWin //e ROM.
  * Manual ROM reload - you can put your ROM files anywhere.
  * Experimental mouse support: you will need to have Apple Oasis and do
    "BSAVE MOUSE.ROM,A$Cn00,L$100" (where n is the mouse port, default 4)
    onto a DOS 3.3 formatted disk, and use its Disk Manager to copy the
    file over to the MS-DOS side.
  * Bugfix in the BRK opcode (BRK flag wasn't being reset).
  * Bugfix: IRQ masking was not emulated properly.
  * Old Apple //e ROM passes self-test.
  * Joystick centering tweaked.

I have NOT yet implemented a tree directory structure.  Haven't had the
time, and I'm running dangerously low on hard disk space (and Norton
Commander won't ZIP through directories).  Real Soon Now ;)
