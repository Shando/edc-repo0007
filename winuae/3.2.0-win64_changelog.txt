3.2.0

Beta 20:

- Map ROM feature was not JIT direct compatible (JIT update few betas ago)
- Do not initialize CD drivers twice. (scsi passthrought, ioctl, image)
- Fix compatibility with old config files (before 68000/010 32-bit addressing option was added),
  force 24-bit addressing if config file was saved with 2.8.1 or older.
- Another old config compatibily update, if 68000/010 with chipset extra set to Generic, use more A500-like
  mainboard config than bigbox-like.
- Added Kupke Golem FastSCSI/IDE combo board.
- FastLane SCSI autoconfig mapping fixed.
- ROM scanner prefer roms not in archives update (b15) had exactly opposite effect..

Kupke Golem FastSCSI/IDE:
- SCSI/IDE combo board. Whole board or only IDE can be disabled.
- Fake DMA (SCSI long word wide, usual word wide PIO IDE)
- 4.2 ROM added ("fastscsi device (romversion) V4.2 (06-FEB-95)")
- Boot ROM made in 1995 without custom filesystem support..
- Does not copy ROM code to RAM, driver code executes directly from ROM.

Beta 19:

- Sprite in far right border feature (b1) didn't work correctly in AGA modes that require hires/shres horizontal
  sprite resolution support. (Alien Breed 3D garbage sprite in right border)
- AGA hires/shres horizontal scrolling feature was not fully in sync with sprites (Banshee)
- In some situations bitplane DMA emulation internal state flag got stuck in active state (Aladdin blank screen).

Beta 18:

- If dragndrop to GUI closed GUI (for example config file with show_gui=no), invalid GUI windows handle was accessed.
- Don't parse command line again when restarting emulation (for example by loading new config when emulation has
  already been started). Previously command line overrode new config.
- "Forget" all remembered scan line states when forcing full refresh, previously some border region scan lines
  were not refreshed properly when display parameters, for example centering, changed.
- Fixed named pipe unicode format buffer size calculation bug.
- If last command line parameter is a path and it looks like config file or state file: load it automatically.
  Adds support for dragndrop over winuae.exe shortcut with other parameters in shortcut's Target field.
- Automatically resolve all shortcut (*.lnk) paths in command line.
- D3D9 non-shader mode forgot scanline texture when switching modes.
- Fixed off by one bug in input device re-enumeration causing keyboard layout B->A or C->B change.

Beta 17:

- Trace mode in 68000 cycle-exact was 4 cycles too long.
- 68000 cycle-exact mode STOP needs at least 8 cycles before it can wake up.
- Memory-only cycle exact crash when entering GUI.
- Memory-only cycle exact shortcut config entry cycle_exact=memory (Old false and true values have not changed)
- Only use picassoiv_rom_file config entry if it contains valid path. (Workaround for some config files that
  contain picassoiv_rom_file=:NOROM for some reason)
- Z3 Picasso IV was disabled if there was not enough address space even when JIT was disabled (b16).
- JIT on/off change was not delayed until it was safe to do, like other CPU option changes. uae-configuration
  (or similar) on the fly config changes were unreliable in this situation.
- FAT drive mounted as a directory harddrive: file's modification time was not always correct. (2.6.0, wrong
  date field name)
- Warp mode fps limit added, config file only: warp_limit=fps

Beta 16:

- Added Mediator 1200SX autoconfig data.
- Added support for 68020+ CPU floating bus data when clock chip is not connected (Not yet correctly emulated, need
  accurate CPU cycle sequence and more)
- SPS plugin was not searched from all supported directories.
- Don't add fake uae boot rom expansion board if "hide uae expansions" is enabled.
- FPU FPCR and FPIAR was swapped in disassembler.
- CIA-B TOD accurate cycle counting code used CIA-A "is tod on?" variable.. (2.7.x or somewhere close)
- Use official AD1848 crystal value in Toccata emulation (24.576MHz), it seems some Toccata boards have correct
  crystals and some not exactly correct (For example 24.582MHz). Now 48000Hz output is exactly 48000Hz. (was 48011)
- 64-bit JIT FPU rounding mode fix and other 64-bit FPU fixes. (Frode)
- 64-bit QEMU PPC plugin fixed (Frode)
- Added memory accesses only -cycle-exact mode. In this mode CPU does not internally count cycles, only external
  memory accesses are counted, including chipset DMA contention. (This was previously only used when 68040/060 and
  cycle exact was enabled). 68020+ only, at least for now. More compatible (prefetch + caches) also required.
- GUI disk eject button worked unreliably if disk was inserted and then immediately ejected.

Beta 15:

- KS1.2 boot hack improved, now also works with KS 1.1, KS 1.0 and even with 0.7 beta!
- Added old style >2M chip RAM support back as a fallback, used when new method can't extend chip ram size.
- Fixed CAS2 instruction comparison failed case, memory operands should be written to Dc, not Du.
- Support DSKLEN writes while disk DMA is active, update only remaining DMA length without modifying DMA state (undocumented feature).
- If ROM scanner finds same ROM image multiple times, select plain file version if possible (not in archive).

Pre-KS 1.2 boot notes:
- KS 1.1 and older DOS is pure BCPL. Added separate BCPL entry point to directory filesystem
  handler that makes BCPL DOS happy.
- Expansion.library does not exist: MakeDosNode and AddDosNode replacements added.
- Directory filesystem automount/boot fully supported.
- Hardfiles work more or less same as with KS 1.3.
- Boot priority sorting is not supported, first drive is always boot drive. (This can change in the future,
  don't depend on current behavior!)
- WB 1.3 L:FastFileSystem is supported with 1.2 and older versions. (Automatically puts it inside BCPL wrapper and
  patches 1.2+ only CopyMem() calls)
- BCPL stuff from AROS m68k. Most of DOS BCPL was re-implemented and documented by Jason and me in AROS m68k.
- This completes one of the most pointless features ever. Until next most pointless feature.

Beta 14:

- 64-bit JIT fixes. JIT FPU also fixed. (Frode)
- RDB parser dumps block contents to the log if parsing fails.
- SCSI tape request sense tape position bits (end/beginning) was not reported correctly (b7)
- UAE devices (uaeserial, uaescsi and so on) are now supported under KS 1.2.
- Directory harddrives and uaehf.device is now KS 1.2 automount/boot capable.
  KS 1.2 HD boot hack from Multi Evolution driver.

KS 1.2 boot notes:
- Logic reverse engineered from Multi Evolution SCSI driver.
- First drive in Harddrives panel is boot drive, even if it has lower boot priority than other drives.
- If boot priority = -128 (no autoboot): don't enable fake DF0: boot disk hack.
- Ugly hack. Temporarily patches DoIO() to inject fake df0: boot block and PutMsg() to get control after
  dos has been initialized.

Beta 13:

- SCSI emulation INQUIRY command didn't clear old data in output buffer (b7)
- Do not abort uaehf.device RDB parsing if drive init or bad block list is set.
- A2386SX 16M+ memory size crash fix.
- Implemented previously empty QEMU byteswap function, fixes 16-bit Cirrus Logic VGA text mode.
- zlib and libpng (used by screenshot function) updated to latest versions.
- Added PC 3.5" HD 21 sectors/track format to PC floppy size autodetection list. (DMF format)
- Renamed GUI Flash RAM file title, it is also used for A2286/A2386SX CMOS RAM.
- Big Aranym JIT merge. 64-bit version JIT supported. Includes big 32-bit JIT
  changes. May cause breakage. (Frode) PPC support is not (yet) 64-bit compatible.

64-bit compatible JIT notes:

- 2G of Amiga address space available (vs ~1G to ~1.5G in 32-bit version under 64-bit OS).
  Because JIT still requires Amiga address space inside first 4G of host process address space and
  Windows allocates few pages in the middle of first 4G, 2G is the current max. Technically
  this is not a problem because AmigaOS is not really designed to support RAM at 2G-4G of
  address space, programs may use signed pointers and some exec functions use address bit 31
  for error state. (In theory 3G may be possible later if it is really needed)
- Use "UAE" RAM allocation mode (not "Real") if you want max available Z3 RAM (up to
  1.5G. Z3 RAM + RTG VRAM + 256M must be less than or equal to 2G. Anything more = crash.
- 64-bit JIT FPU is not fully functional yet. Do not enable.

Beta 12:

- Boolean config true value converts to 1 and false to zero before doing any calculations.
  someboolentry=[1-someboolentry] custom event string now works as expected.
- Bridgeboard in VGA graphics mode only updated part of display (and sometimes nothing was updated).
- ESP (53C94, FAS216 etc..) SCSI updates to support Multi Evolution (Needs FIFO used count and does odd things)
- Multi Evolution 500/2000 SCSI controller emulation added.
- XT bridgeboard timer gate 2 pin was not hooked up in DOSBox CPU mode. ("Timer2 control function failed")
- Removed RTC status bit hack, PIC_TickIndex() works now. ("The Real Time Clock has not been initialized")
- Delay bridgeboard emulated MDA/CGA VRAM write interrupts until next vblank to reduce number of
  interrupts. (Real hardware may or may not do same)
- Initialize bridgeboard add-on IDE controllers after Z2 boards (was after Z3 which prevents them to
  initialize if used KS ROM does not support Z3 boards and at least one Z3 board was enabled).
- Adjusted MDA/CGA emulation mode hsync/vsync reporting, some programs had really slow screen updates.

Multi Evolution 500/2000:
- Not autoconfig but has boot ROM at $f00000 region. (Autoconfig is only for RAM expansion)
- Boots also under KS 1.2. (Boot ROM does some ugly system patches)
- Long word wide fake DMA.
- Boot image that also shows SCSI detection diagnostics messages.
- At least v3.0 ROM version driver does odd things, it sends MESSAGE ACCEPTED command first, then
  it reads the message byte.

Beta 11:

- Fixed A2386SX default video mode configuration, it is software controlled, not jumper like in
  older models. Fixes unexpected "Invalid configuration information" BIOS messages.
- Added A2386SX-only hack to enable working 1.4M floppy images, I assume it thinks connected drive is
  Amiga 1760k drive and it programs FDC to use 720k (1.4M half speed) bit rate.
- Autodetect *.ima PC disk images inside archives.
- Increased IDE emulation multiple transfer support from 64 blocks to 128 blocks (Max possible).
- Universal XTIDE BIOS load address is now user configurable. (Exxxx does not work in AT systems)
- x86 IDE emulation used wrong byte swapping mode if data port width was 16/32-bit (AT systems)
- Added support for IDE emulation edge triggered interrupts. ISA bus uses edge triggered interrupts,
  Fixes A2386SX IDE configuration hang.
- Only first non-autoconfig "board" was initialized if more than one was configured (for example
  both x86 AT IDE and XT IDE controller was enabled)
- Write-protect 0xDC000 region from Amiga-side writes if it is used by XTIDE Universal BIOS. This
  address conflicts with Amiga-PC shared memory space but fortunately it seems only beginning of this
  space is actually used for Amiga-PC communication.
- XTIDE Universal BIOS hardware is now correctly emulated.
- Per-monitor high DPI update caused repeated GUI re-open in some situations.
- DOSBox CPU modes now use DOSBox hardware timer emulation, fixes A2386SX floppy access delays.
- Added all currently available bridgeboard BIOS ROMs to ROM scanner.
- Cleaned up internal expansion ROM selection code.

NOTE: Nearly all previously created DOS HD images are not supported anymore due to wrong
byte swapping. They need to be created from scratch.

Beta 10:

- IDE emulation internal operation change. Previously next block was read from hardfile after previous
  block was transferred. Now all blocks are buffered first before transferring (or if write: all data
  is received first and then all buffered data is written to HDF). Fixes A2286 BIOS built-in IDE driver
  which does not wait for interrupt or DRQ status bit between transferred blocks. (Which technically is
  a bug, driver is depending on some specific HD manufacturer/model internal implementation detail)
- Amiga to PC bridgeboard interrupt enable/disable state fixed. A2286 Janus hardfile access does not hang
  anymore.
- Added x86 CPU speed adjustment (CPU panel, full left = fastest possible mode). Note that some BIOS
  drivers use CPU delay loops, unexpected things can happen.. Fastest possible enables extra hack
  ("immediate" floppy to prevent floppy detection fail). Speed adjustment is only enabled after initial
  BIOS diagnostics checks have been done because some timer tests fail if CPU is too fast..
- Added right control = right Windows key option. (Keyboards without right Windows key, quicker to use
  than creating custom mapping, note that it also disables keyboard layout B RCTRL=fire mapping)
- GUI window is now per-monitor high DPI aware.
- 3-State Apollo 500/2000 IDE/SCSI combo HD controller fully implemented. ROM added to ROM scanner.
  3rd party replacement ROM available from Aminet. (http://aminet.net/package/disk/cdrom/AT_ApolloDev)
- CDFS automount without physical drives mounted 10 empty image drives (b1).

Beta 9:

- x86 floppy controller EOT parameter was read from wrong offset. Note that previously 1.4M floppy in
  720K drive (configured in 2286+ BIOS) worked, not anymore.
- Added x86 bridgeboard 1.2M PC floppy image support.
- Added Advanced chipset option that emulates some 68040/060 board's (for example Blizzard 1240/1260)
  custom register byte write "bug" where byte write to custom register does not write same value to
  both upper and lower byte. Previously this was always enabled if CPU type was 68060.
  (Writing to even address: zero written to odd address, writing to odd address: works "correctly")
- Fixed emulation boot crash if mouse driver was enabled (b8)
- x86 IDE config didn't load correctly. (Reset and save needed to fix it). x86 VGA also needs config
  reset.

Beta 8:

- Many saved accelerator board enabled configurations loaded incorrectly in b7.
- PicassoIV ROM selection in expansion panel caused crashes. (b6)
- Added DCTV emulation. Colors are not yet correct.
  Blurriness is mostly correct, DCTV is composite out only, horizontal resolution is only 320 pixels,
  color resolution is worse (color bleeding). Some filtering is still needed to simulate real composite
  signal.
- Another Cirrus Logic mode change crash fix. (x86 bridgeboard reset when in text mode).
- x86 bridgeboard 720k/1440k floppy images supported.

Beta 7:

- 68030 prefetch/ce mode now also uses improved prefetch pipeline emulation.
- b4 prefetch RTS (and others) special case does not exist, my original test must have been broken.
- GUI won't anymore allow multiple sound or network cards enabled at the same. (It has never been
  supported configuration)
- Cirrus Logic out of bounds VRAM access check improved.
- Picasso IV ROM loader update didn't support all old ROM paths (b6)
- SCSI Unit Attention (bus reset/media change) status handling should be now exactly as described in
  SCSI spec. (Roctec Rochard v2 boot ROM*)
- A1060 Diagnostics and 8087 jumper was inverted.
- Continuing WD SCSI transfer with another Select and Transfer when previous SaT had already transferred
  all buffered data: new SaT restarted from beginning. (A590/A2091 omniscsi.device + cdfs)
- Config file loaded with non-existing *_rom_file_id: rom key file ("rom" with ID=0) was selected.
- M-Tec E-Matrix 530 accelerator board added (Thanks to Jozsef Vamosi)

Rochard RH800C with v2 boot ROM:
- Supports both SCSI and IDE. v1 is IDE only.
- Has crazy "Is drive ready?" polling routine, driver executes 300 (!) TEST UNIT READY commands in
  CPU loop per LUN (timer.device exists for a reason..), with single SCSI drive, driver executes total
  6*300=1800 TUR commands during drive detection! (I recommend not to enable scsi logging..)
- ROM not yet added.

M-Tec E-Matrix 530:
- ROM image is software dumped (chip is not socketed), ROM layout (single chip contains two logical
  autoconfig boot ROMs) may not match real ROM dump.
- 53C94 based SCSI. Fake DMA, 2*long word wide data port. Whole transfer loop runs in level 2
  interrupt routine..
- Boot ROM requires KS2.0+ only because it calls CacheControl() without checking ROM version.

Beta 6:

- Bridgeboard floppy drive motor and click sound supported.
- x86 CPU status string was visible even when bridgeboard was not active.
- Added software readable A4091 DIP switches and Warp Engine SCSI jumpers to GUI. Note that default
  jumper state for Warp Engine is "No autoboot", you need to set all 3 jumpers to re-enable previous
  autoboot configuration.
- Even more Z2 and Z3 board address validation, do not map the board if OS attempts to map it over any
  existing mapped space. Some Z2/Z3 boards didn't use validating memory bank map routines.
- A590 XT drive emulation uses now generic "custom" HD emulation like all recently added MFM/RLL
  controllers. Automatic geometry fixing removed, it can cause problems.
- Fixed A590 XT random bug that tried to start DMA transfer middle of command phase in some situations.
- Remember last open Expansion panel expansion device, saved to config file.
- A2286 "The Real Time Clock has not been initialized." message is gone.
- A2386SX CMOS RAM size fixed, but BIOS still complains about invalid configuration and setup screen
  shows incorrect extended RAM size. (Why? Early boot phase extended RAM size counter is correct.)
  Floppy drive access also seems to stall for 5s+ regularly and then work normally again.
- Added x86 bridgeboard AT IDE drive emulation. Selection under IDE controllers. Only A2286 and A2386SX
  have BIOS support for AT IDE. At least fdisk and formatting confirmed working.
- Added IDE commands 0x40 and 0x41 (READ VERIFY SECTOR(S)), BIOS code uses it during formatting.
- Added support for XTIDE Universal BIOS (https://code.google.com/p/xtideuniversalbios/) See notes.
- Added support for IDE emulation 8-bit data port width. (XT mode XTIDE Universal BIOS)
- Only show SASI harddrive types if selected controller uses SASI-like commands.
- Cirrus Logic hardware emulation text modes used graphics mode resolution when selecting host screen
  size. Larger than 8 pixel font width text mode was too narrow.
- Added x86 VGA board emulation (uses already existing Cirrus Logic emulation).

x86 bridgeboard VGA notes:
- Does not autoswitch, use END+F9 to switch between screens.
- Empty Amiga-side Janus PC window must still be open to enable keyboard input.
- It is not possible (at least not yet) to have Amiga RTG board enabled at the same time.
- VGA uses A0000-BFFFF, make sure bridgeboard "Address Sector" does not conflict. (Bad
  memories are starting to return from PC DOS era...)

RTG ROM configuration notes:
- Expansion panel has new "RTG board" category that currently lists 2 boards that need rom image,
  Picasso IV and x86 bridgeboard VGA ISA card.
- This selection is currently a special case: selected ROM gets automatically removed when RTG board
  is changed, always use RTG panel first to select the board, then Expansion panel to set the ROM.
- If Picasso IV ROM is not selected ("ROM disabled"): old rom loading method is used. In other words,
  you can ignore whole RTG ROM configuration if you are never going to use x86 bridgeboard VGA card.
- Probably any old ISA Cirrus Logic GD542x VGA ROM can be used, for example
  http://www.vgamuseum.info/index.php/component/k2/item/131-cirrus-logic-cl-gd5420
  or http://www.nongnu.org/vgabios/ seems to work.

XTIDE Universal BIOS notes:
- BIOS is loaded at 0xEC000 to guarantee it becoming last BIOS extension, it is required to make it
  work properly if there are other extensions (Janus handler/library). Make sure bridgeboard
  "Address sector" is not conflicting (D0000-DFFFF works fine, for some reason no BIOS checks A0000
  to AFFFF region but it is documented as existing option in hardware).
- Uses Universal BIOS defaults (IO address base 0x300, no interrupt).
- A1060 and A2088 confirmed working.

Beta 5:

- Added OMTI-Adapter HD controller, same as ALF1 but different hardware base address.
- It was not possible to select HDF PCMCIA SRAM and IDE options.
- Flash ROM file and RTC battery backed up RAM file dialog didn't allow creation of new files.
- Made disk image dragndrop floppy drive hit box larger.
- ROM panel drag drop over ROM paths will work as expected. Previously it was always autodetected
  and "best" ROM path was selected. Now autodetection will be only used when dropped over empty space.
- Harddrives panel CD path dragndrop update.
- ProWizard written module files now include name of inserted disk in DF0: or CD image, like screenshot file names.

x86 bridgeboard updates:
- A2286 and A2386SX emulation implemented. CPU and FPU core, keyboard, interrupt controller and
  more from DOSBox. A2386SX BIOS is still misdetecting things.
- Floppy drive label is changed between DF2:<>A: and DF3:<>B: if configured as PC bridge drive.
  (Note that if you don't configure any PC drives, you will get really slow BIOS floppy detection)
- Added 40 track (5.25" 360k) and 80 track (all others) drive selection. This must match inserted image
  or BIOS drive detection will get confused.
- Always do full disk image size autodetection when disk is inserted in PC bridge drive. Without
  it most dos disks was detected as undersized adf images.
- A2286/A2386 CMOS RAM is stored to disk if ROM panel Flash RAM file path is set.
- DOSBox CPU core type selectable in bridgeboard config GUI, also 8088-based bridgeboards
  can be optinally configured to use DOSBox CPU core.

Beta 4:

- RTG<>chipset mode switching didn't check if modes have different filter type (forgot to add
  when RTG filter support was implemented)
- 68020/030 prefetch pipeline b3 missing addressing mode implemented. Other adjustments: single
  word unconditional branch-like instruction (for example RTS) stop prefetches immediately but
  conditional single opcode always prefetch one extra word before stopping. Bcc.S (when not
  branching) and DBcc probably aren't exactly right yet.
- A2090 ST-506 support implemented.
- Note about existing configurations that use A590 XT support: drive type (SCSI ID/XT) must be reset.
- GUI default windowed mode window size (when it runs for the first time and size information is not
  yet stored in registry/ini) is now adjusted for high DPI screen. (Windows 8.1+ only). Previously
  default size was far too small on high DPI displays.
- Added "I am Windows 10 compatible" manifest entry, winuaebootlog.txt now shows correct Windows 10
  version information.
- Cleaned up pfield_do_linetoscr() mess.
- Added support for AGA subpixel bitplane delays (lores pixel can horizontally scroll 4 shres or 2
  hires pixels or hires pixel 2 shres pixels). Limit: only works if both odd and even planes have
  same subpixel scroll value (which probably is true practically in all situations)
- b1 sprite right border corner case broke SSCAN2 sprite horizontal duplication.
- x86 bridgeboard emulation! A1060 Sidecar, A2088 and A2088T currently implemented.

x86 bridgeboard information:
- Currently uses fake86 CPU core + PC support chip emulation. Selected because it was very easy
  to integrate. Possible future A2286+ emulation needs different CPU core.
- All jumpers emulated. (Required redesign of expansion GUI extra config)
- Amiga floppy drive DF2: and DF3: can be re-configured as bridgeboard PC drives A: and B:.
- Only 360k and 720k standard dos disk images supported.
- A2088T 360k/720k compatible drive supported. Floppy switch not implemented.
- A1060 and A2088 apparently only have 360k drive and BIOS support.
- BIOS ROM required. Searching for "A2088 BIOS" or similar should work... No BIOS ROMs
  added to rom scanner.
- Not much real testing done. Boots from dos boot floppy, drive formatting and reading/writing works.
- x86 CPU speed is currently very randomly chosen speed.

Beta 3:

- CD and sound card audio are now always resampled with Anti interpolator before it gets mixed
  with Paula audio stream. Previously it used very crude resampling method.
- ES1370 (SB128) emulation fixed, DMA length register was not reset when playback was restarted.
  (I don't understand how it would have ever worked in QEMU without sound glitches)
- Added "Full PCI DMA" option to PCI bridges that in real world don't have Amiga to/from PCI DMA
  support (Prometheus and Mediators). Default is off = emulates real hardware limits.
- Validate PCI DMA addresses, log message and return random data if trying to access unsupported address
  or if attempting to access Amiga address space and bridge does not have full PCI DMA support.
  (Probably becomes HALT-something if real hardware simply hangs in this situation)
- 68040 MMU mode hardware bus error not caused by MMU had incorrectly status register ATC bit set.
- More reliable A2410 resolution switching.
- A2410 framebuffer space is also mirrored at the beginning of TMS34010 address space.
- Implemented A2410 TMS34010 to/from Amiga address space DMA feature. So far no programs found that
  uses it.
- Emulate 68020/030 prefetch pipeline more accurately, branch instructions stop prefetching after
  last opword of branch instruction has been loaded. It reduces unnecessary memory accesses.
  This probably also makes 68020/030 cycle exact mode even more faster without adjusting
  other parts of emulation (which needed to be made faster because some other unknown part
  was too slow, hopefully it was this prefetch feature..)
  Not fully implemented yet, addressing modes that use brief or full extension words disable
  this feature until next branch instruction because length of instruction needs to be known in
  advance and in these addressing modes it can't be calculated statically.

Beta 2:

- Borderblanking works again (b1)
- RTL8029 received packets got sometimes stuck in receive buffer until next packet was received.
- Fixed PCI bridge unreliable interrupts in some situations.
- Added Mainhattan Data Paradox SCSI emulation.
- Added Spirit Technology HDA-506 HD controller.
- Added Elaborate Bytes A.L.F. HD controller.
- Built-in wave recording created huge files, bytes-to-write variable was never reset (3.1).
- Added Mediator 1200 autoconfig data.
- Added support for multi-function PCI devices.
- Added ES1370 from QEMU. (PCI sound card), common ES1370 based card is SB128.
- Added FM801 emulation. (PCI sound card).
- Added Vortex System 2000 HD controller.
- 68020/030 prefetch/cycle-exact: don't prefetch from old PC if instruction is going to branch.
- Accelerator board memory size reset when viewing RAM GUI panel if accelerator used "Blizzard" RAM type.
- HD and RTG boards are now named <name> (<manufacturer>).
- A2410 display card emulation! TMS34010 emulation core from MAME.

A2410 notes:
- Very strange display board.. Very flexible TMS34010 CPU on board, code uploaded to internal
  RAM from Amiga-side. Unfortunately board never had good software support.
- Current WinUAE direct RTG system requires Amiga-side mapped VRAM, but because A2410
  does not have any linear mapped Amiga-visible VRAM, A2410 internal VRAM is "fake" mapped at 0xa00000
  (normally unused CIA space). It shouldn't cause any problems.
- Interlaced modes are not supported (Original code didn't support it all, I added quick hack
  that doubles height in interlaced modes), either CGX4 driver is wrong or TMS34010 documentation
  is wrong, documentation says "The size of the DUDATE increment specified for an interlaced display
  should be twice that required for a noninterlaced display of the same dimensions" but CGX4 driver
  uses same width value in both interlaced and non-interlaced 1024*768 mode.
- BT458 RAMDAC Overlay bitplanes fully emulated, including blinking features.
- CGX4, Amix, NetBSD console and demo programs from DevCD (Milan 1991 DevCon) confirmed working.
- END+F9 can be used to manually switch between native and A2410 display.
- CGX4 driver seems to have bug in overlay (mouse pointer) color setup routine.
- Emulated Amiga randomly hangs when switching CGX display modes. Reason unknown.
- TMS34010 CPU execution speed is probably totally wrong and very random.
- Because TMS34010 can update any register or RAM data any time it wants (like copper but more flexible),
  emulation needs to be at least line-based (not frame like other RTG boards) and because emulation
  also needs to execute TMS34010 code, A2410 emulation is slower than other RTG boards.
- A2410 has DMA and hardware byte swap circuitry (can be seen in schematics) but so far I haven't found
  programs that use it. (A2410 DMA = TMS34010 CPU can directly access Amiga address space).
- Must use 32-bit host display depth. 16-bit is not supported.

Mainhattan Data Paradox SCSI:
- Parallel port to SCSI adapter.
- Non autoboot.
- Make sure no other parallel port devices are enabled at the same time.

Spirit Technology HDA-506:
- Supports autoboot but it is not implemented, ROM dump not available.
- OMTI controller, uses early SCSI-like protocol but addressing uses CHS instead of LBA.

Elaborate Bytes A.L.F.:
- Non autoboot.
- MFM/RLL controller.
- Same protocol as HDA-506 but there can be differences in some commands.

Vortex System 2000:
- Supports autoboot but ROM image is not available.
- Non autoconfig, ROM and IO hardwired at 0xf00000.
- Again same protocol as HDA-506.
- Fake DMA, 2xword data port size. Some sites incorrectly lists it as a DMA controller.

Beta 1:

- Emulated sprite undocumented special case, sprite start hpos from 2 to 9 will be visible at the
  very far right overscan border of display.
- WinPCap network mode didn't detect any devices (broken some time ago)
- ROM type configuration for expansion sub devices. SupraDrive A2000 DMA does not anymore list
  incompatible AMABx ROMs. (A2000 DMA model ROM is still MIA)
- Improved SCSI/IDE controller init log messages.
- Fastlane and Z3 RAM configured: use Fastlane Z3 RAM autoconfig data.
- Handle recursive default_xlate() calls, can happen if autoconfig mapping is really bad.
- Accelerator with GVP Series II SCSI controller + GVP Series II SCSI expansion controller combination
  didn't work.
- Accelerators that include autoconfig RAM (Only GVP A530 currently) now include matching RAM autoconfig
  parameter data.
- WASAPI audio init may have caused crash if some WASAPI query functions returned error code.
- Implemented support framework for PCI bridges.
- dm debugger command shows PCI bridges and PCI boards.
- Added DKB Wildfire accelerator board.
- Check and halt if any illegal autoconfig remap is done. (Instead of causing pointless reset loop)
- Added support for ECS Denise genlock features. (Did any program ever use ECS genlock features?)
- Expansions boards without ROM now have simple enable/disable checkbox.
- PCI Realtek 8029 added from QEMU (NE2000 clone), automatically connected to any enabled PCI bridge.
- Moved accelerator and expansion board GUI items to new Expansions panel. Old Expansion panel
  is now RTG settings only panel.
- More 68030 data cache emulation fixes.
- Added generic SASI (SCSI predecessor) controller emulation and SASI HD GUI selection.
- Added Tecmar T-Card/T-Disk expansion/SASI HD controller.
- Added Xebec 9720H HD controller.
- Audio period modulation with zero period value stopped modulated channel.
- Blizzard 1230IV default ROM was incorrect.
- If no physical/virtual CD drives available and image drive was not manually selected:
  automatically select empty image drive. Previously emulated drive was removed.
- Blizzard SCSI Kit IV configuration weirdness fixed, old config is not compatible anymore.
- SSE2 capable CPU is now required.
- If you use WINE, 1.7.44 or newer required.
- Files are now 7zip compressed.

New Most Pointless Feature Ever:
- Genlock emulation can now replace transparent pixels with noise pattern or static image.
- Implements also ECS new genlock features (I still think there is no software that uses them..)
- Transparency control.

DKB Wildfire:
- Interesting design, SCSI and ethernet chips are connected to internal PCI bus that boot ROM
  initializes. (Reason why PCI bridge emulation had to exist first)
- SCSI is emulated, uses same QEMU 53c895 emulation as CSPPC.
- Ethernet is not emulated.
- Boot ROM is stored in 2*32k parallel EEPROM chips. Wildfire flash update program supported but
  but modified data is not saved back to rom image file.
- ROM image is from install disk.
- Boot menu (keep right mouse button pressed while booting) options are not yet saved to file,
  it looks like it is saved to 3rd(!) Flash/EEPROM chip via 53C815 built-in ROM support circuitry.
  High resolution image of the board is needed.
- Board config space ($ffff0000) bits are not emulated, except 68000 mode which only halts the
  emulation.

PCI bridges:
- Wildfire with 53C815 chip connected to first internal PCI slot.
- Prometheus.
- G-REX. NOTE: only supported by latest 44.71 CSPPC/BPPC boot ROM.
- Mediator 1200TX and 4000MK2. (If you have other model, please contact me)
- Only 53C815 (Wildfire only) and Realtek 8029 PCI devices implemented so far.

Try not to ask non-emulation related PCI bridge questions (like which driver to use, where to find
them, how to install them, how to configure 8029 driver and so on..), thanks.

Tecmar T-Card/T-Disk:
- The very first Amiga harddrive controller.
- No autoboot, no automount, no RDB.
- KS 1.0 and 1.1 compatible, possibly also earlier version. Not KS 1.2+ compatible.
- SASI controller, make sure SASI drive type is selected.
- Implements old style autoconfig that was documented in first HRM revision, Appendix_G,
  Disk based autoconfig driver ("xbus.resource"). Not compatible with KS 1.2+ ROM based
  expansion.device. Possibly the only released hardware with old style autoconfig.
- Memory board emulated (Use second fast ram slider, autoconfig must be disabled).
- Clock emulated.

Xebec 9720H:
- Another very early Amiga harddrive controller.
- No autoboot, no automount, no RDB, SASI.
- Not autoconfig, hardwired at $600000.
- 5380 based, on-board 16k SRAM, 5380<>SRAM DMA. SRAM<>CPU PIO.
