v2.0.2 - April 25, 2005
- Fixed a major performance bottleneck in the use of the Direct3D Present()
  function. Turns out there is a big difference between "IMMEDIATE" and
  "DONOTWAIT" that the Direct3D docs don't exactly make clear. The end result
  is that the emulation should be MUCH smoother for everyone in this release.
- Enabled Electronic Computer System (ECS) support. Games that used the ECS
  now work correctly, including The Jetsons, Melody Blaster, Mind Strike,
  Mr. Basic, Scooby Doo's Maze Chase, the Song Players, and World Series
  Major League Baseball. The input configuration dialog still needs some
  cleanup work related to the ECS, but at least it's functional for now.
- Added support for banked ROMs in cartridges. As a result, World Series Major
  League Baseball now works correctly.
- Fixed several collision detection problems (Space Spartans, Mouse Trap, etc.)
- Reworked .bin/.int support to no longer use bin2rip.exe. The database of
  known cartridges is exposed in the file "knowncarts.cfg". If you update
  this file to add new cartridges or fix existing mappings, please send
  me your updates so others can benefit.
- Several carts in .bin/.int format that were not loading properly are
  now working (AD&D Treasure of Tarmin, for example).
- Added support for cartridge RAM. Land Battle and USCF Chess are now
  working.
- Added .zip support. Bliss will search for the first .bin or .int file
  found in the .zip that matches a known configuration in the "knowncarts.cfg"
  database and attempt to load it.
- Reworked .rom support to no longer use rom2rip.exe
