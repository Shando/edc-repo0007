--------------------------------------------

* ZIP support added !
* We can define the directories for saves files.
* Full-Screen is fixed for both voodoo3 and savage4 videos cards.
* FM timers fixed (voices are now played at good pitch for comix zone, aladdin, cool spot ...)
* H-Int finally fixed : Top Gear 2 and Lotus 2 looks good !
* Z80 interrupt fixed (bubsy works and censor smiley demo has music)
* Controllers code fixed again (American gladiators and Forgotten worlds are playable)
* I've removed the hack for double dragon, super off road ... because it causes problems with
  a few rom (like road rash 3) then they doesn't work any more :(
* Some others little changes ...
