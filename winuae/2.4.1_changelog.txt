2.4.1

- Try to flush GPU queue after rendering the frame to prevent delayed background flipping that
  introduces tearing on fastest possible no buffer low latency mode.
- Integer scaling + gfx_xcenter_pos or gfx_ycenter_pos set had wrong positioning.

Beta 14: (RC3)

- Cycle-exact/approximate CPU speed non-vsync b1 sound sync update didn't work, it did nothing.
- Some more low latency vsync timing updates, improved dynamic adjustment.
- Legacy vsync slowdown problems fixed (2.4.0)
- Restored (50Hz) and (60Hz) fake rates that were removed in 2.4.0. Only available in legacy vsync mode.
- RTG + low latency vsync was not stable.

Beta 13: (RC2)

- Possible improvement for low latency no buffer mode tearing problem.
  - Fastest possible CPU: very simple dynamic flip delay timing adjustment. Reduces tearing (and slows
  down CPU emulation speed) but won't fix it completely. Difficult problem to solve 100% without
  losing too much CPU speed. Currently only way to remove tearing is to reduce CPU speed.
  - Cycle-exact/approximate CPU: Tearing problem on some systems should be fixed.
- Fastes possible low latency vsync sometimes flipped buffers before or during internal frame rendering,
  usual result was same frame being shown multiple times.
- Legacy vsync refresh rate didn't override internal chipset refresh rate causing very bad slow down
  if rates didn't match.
- Map directory filesystem Windows error ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER to AOS ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_AROUND, 
  GetFreeSpace("path to empty CD drive") returns this code on some systems.
- Validate SCSI INQUIRY data before using it when requesting IOCTL CDROM vendor and product names.
  It seems query can return success without returning any data in some situations.
- Store beta dialog state to winuae.ini if enabled.
- Random bsdsocket crash when calling gethostbyname() with numeric IP address. (2.4.0)
- Allow again zero back buffers in DirectDraw mode, 2.3.3 allowed this configuration.
- Canceling HD HDF cloning froze the GUI. (Possibly Vista and newer only)
- Store also monitor's system specific id string to config file, system can have multiple identical monitors.

Beta 12: (RC1)

- More Fastest possible + low latency vsync tweaks.
- Ignore sprite 0 (normally mouse pointer) when calculating autoscale position and size.
- Custom Input event editor usually crashed.
- CD32 boot screen autoscale improved.
- b10 "show drives that require admin privileges" hide drives that also have drive letter.
  Background info: for some strange reason USB memory card adapters have two devices, one (without drive letter) that can't
  be accessed without admin privileges and drive letter device that can be accessed.
- Fastest possible CPU + low latency vsync and double frame mode (85Hz+) jitter fixed.
- "Masks" in filter panel is selected by default, "Overlays" is only selected if overlay image is already configured.
- Possible fix for D3D mask alignment errors in some scaling settings.

Beta 11:

- Adjusted Fastest Possible timing a bit more..
- Better PC interlace screen mode detection.
- Fixed invalid MFM encoding when converting standard adf unencoded data to MFM encoding. (Few incorrect MFM clock bits) Another
  "no one cares" fix (since the beginning, does not affect adf data quality), noticed when testing m68k AROS trackdisk.device write support.
- Vsync mode sound sync shouldn't be that aggressive. (b8)

Beta 10:

- Partial rewrite of fastest possible CPU low latency vsync detection code. Should fix jitter caused by frame not always
  getting shown on screen at correct time.
- Low latency vsync and double frame mode (85Hz+): guarantee every other vblank is really skipped, previously it didn't
  work correctly in some situations.
- Calculate final vblank busywait time from selected rate instead of using hardcoded 50Hz/100Hz-only compatible value.
  Fixes >50Hz no-buffer jitters.
- Emulate extra CPU time if it has been more than 7 lines since last extra CPU time, matches older behavior without
  losing 2.4.0+ performance increase.
- Fixed low latency vsync + fastest possible CPU getting in state where FPS dropped greatly temporarily, usually at startup.
- Show also drives that require admin privileges in harddrives panel, unselectable and marked with "Access denied"
  label. Only name shown because accessing any other attribute may require admin privileges.

Beta 9:

- Fixed D3D texture reallocation ordering. Caused blank screen or other strange side-effects (b7)

Beta 8:

- 68EC020/68020 state files didn't load properly if current CPU config didn't match.
- Adjusted JIT timing a bit, possible fix for slowdowns on some systems.
- Made sound sync a bit more aggressive. (2.4.0 relaxed it a bit too much, I think)
- D3D crash fixed (b7)
- CIA related rare statefile CPU TRACE error fixed.
- Crash fixed when CDFS CD drives enabled without any harddrives.
- Disable USB HID RAWINPUT (Fallback to Direct Input) if "blacklisted" devices found, added
  RM-203 USB adapter to list because it requires calibration which WinUAE can't support.

Beta 7:

- DirectDraw full-window mode on non-primary monitor was blank.
- Adjusted (again) fastest possible CPU mode extra CPU time scheduling, trying to find balance between better
  timing syncronization and not causing unnecessary slowdowns on some systems..
- OCS Denise bug emulation update, PAL STREQU counts are 8 (short field) or 9 (long field) lines, not static 9 lines.
  (Probably no program cares)
- F11 in gameports/input test mode shows next page (if list is longer than visible area).
- Manual display positioning X coordinate offset fixed (Filter panel or gfx_center_horizontal_position)
  Origin should be hardware position 0 (same as sprites), not first possible visible position.
- Fastest possible low latency vsync should work better again (b2), plus some other adjustments done, CPU throttling
  supported.
- Autoresolution worked badly in some situations.
- Removed USB_DEVICE_ID_RETRO_ADAPTER from USB "quirks" list, apparently it is working correctly according
  to firmware sources. (Perhaps older version was wrong, not exactly sure why it was included in Linux HID quirks list)
- Save also selected monitor name (gfx_display_name) to config file because order of displays can change when removing
  or adding monitors or replacing display cards.

Beta 6:

- Most CDFS RockRidge file comments were truncated. (Very stupid bug)
- CDFS media change still crashed in some situations.
- Show "UAE" as HD controller, not "n/a" (same as "IDE0" and others do)
- Improved fastest possible CPU throttle option. (Less CPU% usage)
- If fastest possible CPU does not have enough frame time for extra CPU emulation, reduce extra time in next frame to
  prevent possible high CPU% usage and slowdowns.
- Fullwindow RTG, D3D and scaling in Expansion panel enabled: switching to bigger RTG resolution than max fullwindow crashed. (b2)
- Updated statically linked zlib and libpng to latest versions (1.2.6 and 1.5.10)
- Debugger basic math operators support (+-*/) added, for example "m 8+100*4" lists memory beginning from 0x408. Note that space
  is not allowed because it is parameter separator.
- Borderblank didn't work if BPLCON3 was only written outside of displayable area (b5). This is still quite ugly implemention,
  it should be done similar to COLOR0 handling but it would require too big changes. Later..
- A2024 2 lowest RGB bits set correctly, was always cleared previously.
- Keyboard reset warning fixed (2.4.0)
- Fixed 1-3 line background color bar on top of screen in autoscale modes (2.4.0)
- USB joypad/joystick rawinput dpad diagonal movement fix. (2.4.0)
  
Beta 5:

- Left edge display limit fix, it was correct when in lores but OCS/ECS hires max overscan
  (or AGA in 16-bit fetchmode) can start 8 pixels earlier. (ECS SuperPlus missing left edge)
- Tweaked programmed mode sync positioning algorithm.
- Use config file gfx_top_windowed and gfx_left_windowed top/left window coordinates if borderless mode.
- Sort filter presets alphabetically.
- When calculating autoscale position, restrict left and right side of display inside hsync end and start positions,
  fixes really wide display in promoted modes. Note that autoscale can't work correctly in (some?) promoted
  modes because viewable area is larger than visible bitmap = borders are visible.
- DirectDraw mode wasn't re-initialized correctly when window size changed causing blank screen.
- Borderblank didn't blank topmost lines and last line. (Old bug which usually wasn't visible until now)
- Clear display decision tables when switching modes to prevent old, now possibly unvailable lines to be visible in new mode.
- Possible fix for mouse pointer jumping to (0,0) when pressing buttons and running on some virtual machines. (2.3.3)

Beta 4:

- 68020 CE mode statefile CPUTRACE (CPU state can be saved even in mid instruction) support was not complete,
  should fix "CPU trace: blah" errors when restoring statefiles. It can't fix already created broken statefiles.
- Fix built-in CDFS lowercase conversion. Only convert to lower case if plain ISO-9660 (without RockRidge or Joliet)
  also convert from second character to match CacheCDFS default behavior. Fixes AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 CD file names.
- Automatic scale/center/resize didn't like screen mode that has horizontal start as early as possible (SuperPlus + ECS)
- Automatic resize kept resizing forever in interlaced modes. (2.4)
- Do not emulate ECS Agnus internal 1M address space if JIT enabled and 0.5M Chip RAM because JIT ignores memory
  bank masks causing OS to misdetect full 1M Chip.

Beta 3:

- On screen led status line was drawn using both D3D sprite and directly to bitmap methods in D3D no-filter mode (b2).
- Removed PAL/NTSC vertical scaling hack which is not needed anymore.
- PAL/NTSC vertical scaling added to Fullscreen (TV)/(Max) filter modes.
- Fullscreen (TV)/(Max) also handles programmed modes like real monitor would, positioning and scaling using sync parameters.
- Fake 60Hz (VPOSW poking) did nothing. (2.4)
- DirectDraw + null filter crash fixed when display height was smaller than emulated display height. (b2)
- D3D overlay mask scaling artifact in some resolutions (2.4)
- CDFS CD drive statefile support.
- Ignore duplicate HID button IDs.
- Reduced flicker when refresh rate changes (PAL<>NTSC or other mode changes)

Beta 2:

- Filter system partial rewrite again. Do not use static display buffer. Always dynamically reallocate internal buffer if
  display mode changes (double scan modes, A2024 etc..). Fixes slowdown introduced in 2.4, also fixes shader filters
  that expect texture size = output size. Very tall (>1024 line) programmed modes are also now fully visible.
  Most likely some more updates needed..
- Always cancel custom event autofire if any release event arrives.

Beta 1:

- Input custom event autofire support.
- Automatically switch to another monitor if current monitor does not support selected RTG mode.
  (RTG mode list always lists all monitors' modes)
- CDFS ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL crash. (It seems this was 2.4's most stupid bug)
- Fastest possible CPU mode (including JIT) CPU speed throttle option. 
- Non fastest possible CPU mode CPU speed adjustment option. Currently GUI allows from -90% to 500%.
- Removed Adjustable CPU/Chipset speed option, above option should be much better.
- Switch from 16bit to 32bit (or vice versa) on startup if selected color depth does not exist.
  (Beta Windows 8 + NVidia don't seem to have any 16bit modes)
- Experimental sound sync update. Should increase stability of sound sync in non-fastest modes.
  (Side-effects possible)
