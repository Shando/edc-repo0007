Changes from 0.08 to 0.10
-------------------------
  * Moved the LEDs around a bit.
  * Supports a real joystick via the standard INT$15 interface.  Unlike
    Dapple, there is no need to run a calibration routine.  Note that a
    real-mode interrupt call has overhead from thunking down to 8088 mode
    and back up to 386 mode.
  * Primitive savestate support.
  * Work progresses on the Disk ][ emulation.
  * Removed a disk menu kludge.
