version 2.02 (25-11-2003)
=========================

small update (again)

- improved motion blur, 
  reel speed is now updated at a fixed interval.
  This solves the problem with the dutch "Cops'n'Robbers" system85

- Alpha display scroll mode fixed. ( fixes problem with BFM "Club Grandslam" )
  (The display scrolled to soon )

  note: flash modes are not emulated yet.
        (never have been emulated, but they will be ...)

- Machine status now displays (usefull) info of current alphadisplay modes.

- wrongly dumped Scorpion2 Soundproms (2Mbit/4Mbit)
  are now detected and garbage is ignored. (no more samples of 0 bytes )

- screen updates use 'GDISetBatchLimit', should improve drawing speed.
  ( i can't realy see a difference, maybe you can . . .)
