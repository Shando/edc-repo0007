(11/04/2001) Changes Gens 0.98 <- Gens 0.95a :
----------------------------------------------

* Netplay support (Kaillera).
  The games aren't synchronised on DirectSound buffer during Netplay 
  (du to some low frame rate problems) so the sound have some bad noises :(
  Note that Netplay is surely a bit buggy, sorry for it...
* GYM loggin added.
* VDP debug informations added.
* VDP RAM write fixed (broken in Gens 0.8).
* Bug with hilight/shadow effect over sprite fixed (broken in Gens 0.8).
* Because of some incompatibilities with Visual C++ 5.0 and Kaillera, Gens is now compiled with Visual C++ 6.0
* Polish, Catalan and Hungarian menu translation added.
  German, Dutch, Greek and some others updated.
* Add a FAQ section to the gens.txt file.
* A special italian version of Gens.txt in this release but not updated for Gens v0.98.

- Street Racer (hilight effect during intro, broken in v0.8)
- Dino dini's soccer (graphics bugs in font fixed)
