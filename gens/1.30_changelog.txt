(09/11/2001) Changes Gens 1.30 <- Gens 1.20 :
---------------------------------------------

[Sega CD]

* Added the possibility to choose a perfect synchronisation emulation mode.
  This means that main CPU and sub CPU execute instruction by instruction then
  emulation is more accurate but a lot slower.
  This option is desactivated by default, you can enable it when you're playing
  Sega CD games but it's highly recommend to use it only if the game doesn't work
  in normal emulation mode and if your CPU is fast (>= 500 Mhz).
* Fixed a (stupid) bug in the GFX rotation/scaling engine.
* Fixed Word RAM decoded format (dot GFX conversion).
* Added cell GFX conversion.
* CDC -> PCM RAM DMA fixed.
* CDD and CDC emulation improved.
* Fixed the memory control register (not yet perfect).
* Fixed a bug in the "Font Data" calculation.
* Fixed a bug with PCM sound.
* Fixed severals bugs in the MP3 decoder and streaming code.
* Some others minors bugs fixed...

[Genesis]

* YM2612 emulator upgraded to the last version, FM sound is a bit better.
* CGOffline support added.

[General]

  mode than in fullscreen mode.
* Better sound volume adjustement between all differents sound chips.
