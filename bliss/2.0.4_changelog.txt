v2.0.4 - May 14, 2005
- Significantly updated the input configuration capabilities to include the
  following additions, changes, and fixes:
    - Added the ability to bind a combination of inputs to each emulated
      input. This allows you to use multi-key or multi-button combinations as
      an input.
    - Added the ability to bind more than one set of inputs to each emulated
      input. This allows more than one key configurations to activate the same
      emulated input, allowing you to have two joysticks simultaneously mapped
      to the same hand controller, for example.
    - Added the ability to clear all input bindings and configure all inputs
      at once, simplifying the input configuration process.
    - Added the ability to reset an input binding, leaving it completely
      unbound if you don't intend to use it.
    - ECS keyboard inputs are sorted into a more logical order in the input
      configuration window.
    - Changed the input configuration dialog to be resizeable.
    - Fixed a bug with the input configuration dialog where you could not
      configure the ENTER or SPACE keyboard keys.
- In full-screen mode, the mouse cursor now times out and automatically
  disappears after a few seconds with no mouse movement.
- Added the ability to pause the game currently in progress (Alt+P).
- Fixed the bug where the Intellivoice would only speak during the title screen
  of the Intellivoice games, but would not speak the in-game phrases. The
  Intellivoice emulation now properly speaks all phrases.
- Fixed a bug where the ECS keyboard was not being scanned, which prevented
  use of the keyboard in the games that require it.
- Fixed a problem where Bliss wouldn't play nice if you tried to switch to
  another application while in full-screen mode. You can now switch between
  apps with no problems while in full-screen mode.
- Fixed the icon for the settings dialog.
- Made a minor change to graphics rendering to try to fix the graphics glitch
  of offset pixels running in a line from the lower left to the upper right that
  occured on some video cards.
- Settings dialog now correctly selects the first item in the tree every time
  the options window is displayed.
- Accelerator keys are now shown in the window menus.
