3.2.1

- Restoring statefile with FPU crashed.
- If Blizzard RAM allocation fails in non-JIT compatible special case mode, halve memory size and try again
  instead of crashing.
- DDFSTOP special case (changing value during cycle when old DDFSTOP would have matched) triggered
  also when it should not have triggered. (Real / Complex)
- 68020+ accept odd stack when processing exceptions. For some reason I had assumed exceptions need
  aligned supervisor stack.
- GUI Picasso IV ROM config never listed rom scanner detected ROM.
- If RTG board and JIT is enabled but RTG VRAM is located outside of natmem region (For example "real" Z3 address
  at 0x40000000 under 32-bit Windows), disable the board instead of trying to config it in unusable address.
  Previously used hack is not anymore compatible with updated JIT.
- libpng updated to 1.6.19.
- CPU state file buffer overflow when saving 68040+ state.
- If triple buffering, windowed, no vsync and desktop compositing (DWM) enabled, use double buffering.
- 64-bit version didn't load any plugin DLLs without extension (_x64 etc..)
