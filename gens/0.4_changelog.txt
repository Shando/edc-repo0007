(06/04/2000) Changes Gens 0.4 <- Gens 0.39 :
--------------------------------------------
A lot of changes for this new release :

- Gens configuration saved in file ! (finally)
  (You can specify your own file name for special configuration)
- SRAM fixed and entirely implemented (saved in file).
- Mouse cursor now hidden in Full-Screen then you must use
  the right mouse button to access at popup menu  !
- Perfect recovering of sound after 'load state' (only with MZ80 core).
  Saves files are now bigger, but there are compatible with old format.
- DAC (few) noises fixed.
- Some little bugs with VDP DMA fixed.
- Others bugs fixed .....

About 80% (little more) of roms work correctly !
No error messages anymore (like "Starscream core error ...").
If an error occurs, emulation attempt to continue even if can crash.
